<h2 id="c1">PREFACE</h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="book">&lsquo;Climas pas&eacute;, mud&eacute; constelaciones, golfos inavegables, navegando.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Ercilla</span>:
<i>La Araucana</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To read a book to which a friend has asked you
to write a preface is an unusual&mdash;nay, even a
pedantic&mdash;thing to do. It is customary for a
preface-monger to look contemptuously at the
unopened bundle of his friend&rsquo;s proofs, and then
to sit down and overflow you his opinions upon
things created, and those which the creator has
left in chaos. I plead guilty at once to eccentricity,
which is worse than the sin of witchcraft,
for witchcraft at one time may have exposed
one to the chance of the stake; but eccentricity
at all times has placed one outside the pale of
all right-thinking men. To wear a different hat,
waistcoat, or collar, from those affected by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
Apollos who perambulate our streets, to cut your
hair too short, to wear it by the twentieth fraction
of an inch too long, is <i>scandalum magnatum</i>, and
not to be endured. So in confessing that I have
read &lsquo;Down the Orinoco in a Canoe,&rsquo; not only in
the original Spanish in which it first appeared,
but in its English dress, is to condemn myself
out of my own mouth, to be set down a pedant,
perhaps a palterer with the truth, and at the best
a man so wedded to old customs that I might
almost be a Socialist.</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly a far cry to Bogot&aacute;. Personally,
more by good fortune than by any
effort of my own, I know with some degree of
certainty where the place is, and that it is not
built upon the sea. My grandfather was called
upon to mediate between Bolivar and General
Paez, and I believe acquitted himself to the
complete dissatisfaction of them both. Such is
the mediator&rsquo;s meed.</p>
<p>The general public, of whom (or which) I
wish to speak with all respect, is generally,
I take it, in the position of the American
<span class="pb" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
Secretary of State to whom an office-seeker
came with a request to be appointed the United
States Vice-Consul for the town of Bogot&aacute;.
The request was duly granted, and as the
future Consul left the room the Secretary
turned to the author of this book, and said:
&lsquo;Triany, where in thunder is Bogoter, any
way?&rsquo; Still, Bogot&aacute; to-day is, without doubt,
the greatest literary centre south of Panama.
Putting aside the floods of titubating verse
which, like a mental dysentery, afflict all members
of the Spanish-speaking race, in Bogot&aacute;
more serious literary work is done during a
month than in the rest of the republics in a
year. The President himself, Don Jos&eacute; Manuel
Marroquin, during the intervals of peace&mdash;which
in the past have now and then prevailed
in the republic over which he rules&mdash;has found
the time to write a book, &lsquo;El Moro,&rsquo; in which
he draws the adventures of a horse. The book
is written not without literary skill, contains
much lore of horsemanship, and is a veritable
mine of local customs; and for the moral of it&mdash;and
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
surely Presidents, though not anointed,
as are Kings, must have a moral in all they
write, they do and say&mdash;it is enough to make a
man incontinently go out and pawn his spurs.</p>
<p>Thus, Bogot&aacute;, set in its plateau in Columbian
wilds, is in a way a kind of Chibcha Athens.
There all men write, and poets rave and
madden through the land, and only wholesome
necessary revolutions keep their number down.
Still, in the crowd of versifiers one or two, such
as Obeso, the negro poet, who, being denied all
access to the lady of his love&mdash;the colour line
being strictly drawn in Bogot&aacute;, as well befits a
democratic government&mdash;brought out a paper
once a week, entitled <i>Lectura para ti</i>, have
written verse above the average of Spanish
rhyme. Others, again, as Gregorio Gutierrez
Gonzalez and Samuel Uribe Velazquez have
written well on local matters, and Juan de Dios
Carasquilla has produced a novel called &lsquo;Frutos
de mi Tierra,&rsquo; far better than the average
&lsquo;epoch-making&rsquo; work of circulating library and
press.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_ix">ix</div>
<p>P&eacute;rez Triana, son of an ex-President, and
speaking English and Spanish with equal
fluency, is a true son of Bogot&aacute;, and writes
as easily as other people talk.</p>
<p>His book occurred in this wise. The usual
biennial revolution having placed his enemies
in power, he found it requisite to leave
the country with all speed. The seaports
being watched, he then determined, like Fray
Gaspar de Carbajal, to launch his boat upon the
Orinoco, and, that the parallel should be exact,
write an account of all he saw upon the way.
Few books of travel which I have come across
contain less details of the traveller himself.
Strangely enough, he rescued no one single-handed
from great odds. His strength and
valour, and his fertility of brain in times of
peril, together with his patience, far exceeding
that of Indian fakirs, are not obtruded on
the bewildered reader, as is usual in like
cases.</p>
<p>Though armed, and carrying on one occasion
so much lethal stuff as to resemble, as he says
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
himself, a &lsquo;wandering arsenal,&rsquo; he yet slew no
one, nor did he have those love adventures
which happen readily to men in foreign lands
from whom a kitchen wench would turn in
scorn in their own native town: nothing of
empire and little of patriotism is there in his
book. In fact, he says that those who are his
countrymen are those who have the same ideals
as himself&mdash;a cursed theory which, if it once
obtained, would soon abolish Custom-houses,
and render armies useless, make navies all to be
sold for scrap iron, and would leave hundreds
of patriotic sweaters without a platitude. What
chiefly seems to have appealed to this unusual
traveller was the strangeness and beauty of the
long reaches on the interminable waterways,
the brightness of the moon, the thousand noises
of the desert night, the brilliant birds, kaleidoscopic
fish, and the enchantment of a world
remote from all that to a really well-constituted
modern mind makes life endurable. At times,
although I tremble as I write, it seems to me
he doubts of things which we all take on trust,
<span class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
such as the Stock Exchange. Even the army
is not sacred to this democrat, sprung from a
shameless State in which there is no King, and
which, consequently, can never hope to contemplate
a Coronation show, for he retails a
joke current in Columbia, but which, I think,
if duly followed up, might be encountered in
Menander, or, at the least, in Aristophanes.
A Columbian Mayor of a town sent to the
President a hundred volunteers, with a request
that all the ropes should be returned. Jokes
such as these cannot be helpful to a State; in
fact, a joke at all is to a serious man a rank
impertinence, and if an author wishes to obtain
a place within the ranks of Anglo-Saxon
literature, he should not joke at all, or, if he
does, joke about fat or thin men, bald heads or
sea-sickness, or on some subject which the
great public mind has set apart for wit. However,
as a member of the Latin race, it cannot
reasonably be expected of him that at one
bound he should attain unto the fulness of our
Anglo-Saxon grace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xii">xii</div>
<p>The careful reader of this book may possibly
be struck with the different point of view from
which a Latin looks at many questions which
to an Englishman are set immovably as the
foundations of the world, embedded in the
putty of our prejudice.</p>
<p>For instance, on arriving at the open plains
after a tedious journey across mountain ranges
and through forest paths, the thing that interests
the author most is that the land in the
Columbian <i>llanos</i> is not held in many instances
by individuals, but that so scant is population
that it is open to all those who choose
to take it up. This does not strike him as
a folly or as affording room for speculation,
but simply as a fact which, on the whole,
he seems rather to approve of, but without
enthusiasm, looking upon the matter as a
curious generality, but not inclining to refine
or to reduce it to any theory in particular.
A state of mind almost impossible for Saxons
(Anglo or Celtic), who, as a general rule, seem
quite incapable of looking at a proposition as
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
a whole, but must reduce it to its component
parts.</p>
<p>The voyage in itself was memorable, for no
one of the party seems to have been the least
the kind of man who generally ventures upon
journeys of the sort, and furthermore because,
since the first conquerors went down the river
with the faith that in their case, if rightly used,
might have smoothed out all the mountain
ranges in the world, no one except a stray
adventurer, or india-rubber trader, has followed
in their steps. Leal, the jaguar-hunter, who
slew his tigers as I have seen them slain in
Paraguay, on foot, with a forked stick in one
hand and in the other a bamboo lance; the
Indian guide Gati&ntilde;o; and the young Venezuelan
Governor of a State, who, shut up in his house,
fought to the death, his mistress, an ex-ballet
dancer, handing him up loaded guns, are to the
full as striking characters as I have met in any
book of travels outside the types that crowd
the pages of the &lsquo;Conquistadores&rsquo; of America.
The naked Indian in his canoe, before whose
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
eyes the immeasurable wealth of powder,
looking-glasses, a red flannel shirt, and other
treasures, rich and rare to him, were spread,
who yet had strength of mind to scorn them
all rather than pledge his liberty for two days&rsquo;
paddling, is the kind of Indian that merits such
a chronicler as he has found. Long may he
paddle on the <i>ca&ntilde;os</i> and the <i>aguapeys</i>, and die,
still crowned with feathers and with liberty,
as did his fathers, by some forgotten beach or
by some <i>morichal</i>, where parrots chatter and
toucans flit through the leaves, and hummingbirds
hover like bees above the tropic flowers.</p>
<p>What most delights me in the book is that
the author had no settled plan by means of
which he strove to square the circle of the globe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We wandered,&rsquo; as he says, &lsquo;with the definite
aim of reaching the Atlantic Ocean. Beyond
that we did not venture to probe too deeply
the mysterious and wonderful manifestations of
Nature, but took them as they appeared to our
limited means of vision and understanding, and
sought nothing beyond.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xv">xv</div>
<p>A charming way to travel, and a wise, and if
not profitable to commerce, yet to literature,
for books writ in the fashion of this brief
record of a trip through the great waterways
of Venezuelan and Columbian wilds, although
perhaps not &lsquo;epoch-making,&rsquo; yet live and
flourish when the smart travellers&rsquo; tales, bristling
with paltry facts and futile figures, which for
a season were sea-serpents in the press, have
long been pulped to make the soles of ammunition
boots.</p>

<h1 title="">DOWN THE ORINOCO
<br />IN A CANOE</h1>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>The hour was about ten one evening in
December, which in equatorial Andine latitudes
is a month of clear skies, cold winds,
and starry nights. The moon shone brilliantly,
casting upon the ground shadows as clear as
those caused by a strong electric light. Truly,
the local poet who said that such nights as
these might serve as days in other lands was
right.</p>
<p>We came out&mdash;three of us, Alex, Fermin
and I&mdash;through an old Spanish gateway, a
rectangular structure of <i>adobes</i>, or sun-burnt
bricks, capped with a slanting roof of tiles,
dark-reddish and moss-covered, with a swinging
gate of cross wooden beams, held together by
iron bolts. This was the gateway of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
<i>hacienda</i> of Boita, about thirty miles north of
the city of Bogot&aacute;, in the South American
Republic of Colombia. We passed into the
open road, and turned our horses and our
minds northwards.</p>
<p>From south to north, as far as eyes could
see, stretched the road, an old Spanish causeway,
bordered on either side by low-lying stone
fences, in front of which were ditches filled
with water and covered with vegetation.</p>
<p>The ground was hard with the consistency of
baked clay. As no rain had fallen for weeks,
the dust was thick, and the horses&rsquo; hoofs rang
like hammer-strokes upon muffled or broken
brass. We let the reins hang loose, and the
horses, knowing their way, started at a brisk
canter. Wrapped in thought and in our
<i>ponchos</i>, we journeyed on.</p>
<p>No sound was audible; we seemed to be
travelling through a deserted or dead world;
the neighbouring meadows, black beneath the
moon, contrasted with the grayish white line of
the broad causeway. Now and then the solitary
houses, some close to the road, some far back,
loomed up with the magic-lantern effects of
moonlight, and their white walls seemed like
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
huge tombstones in that lonely cemetery.
Sometimes we crossed bridges, under which
the water lay motionless, as though enchanted
by the universal stillness; only a gentle breeze,
causing ripples on the neighbouring pools, made
them glitter and revealed their presence. A
cow or a stray heifer would poise its head
across the stone fence and watch us with
wondering moist eyes, whilst two tiny columns
of condensed breath rose from its nostrils.</p>
<p>Beyond, black and frowning, misshapen and
mysterious, the huge boulders of the Andes
raised their vague outlines, forming a sort of
irregular circle, in some directions quite close
to us, in others lost in the darkness which the
moon and the stars were too remote to overcome.
Indeed, that other local poet was also
right in thinking that under the brilliant moon
those mountains looked like huge sepulchres,
wherein are stored the ashes of dead worlds
upon which judgment had been passed.</p>
<p>And so we journeyed on.</p>
<p>Many travellers have observed that whenever
a voyage of a certain nature is undertaken&mdash;one
that for some reason or other differs
from the ordinary transference of one&rsquo;s self elsewhere,
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
when through circumstances beyond our
control we know that the moment of starting
necessarily marks an epoch in our lives, even
as the beginning of a descent or an ascent from
the summit or the foot of a mountain necessarily
marks a change in our motions&mdash;our
thoughts fly backwards, and not only cover
the immediate time and space behind us, but,
once started, plunge, so to speak, with the
rapidity inherent to them, into the deepest
recesses of our memory, so that, as our bodies
are carried forward, our minds revisit old
scenes, we hold converse with old friends,
and the old-time world seems to live and throb
again within our hearts.</p>
<p>Unheeding the clatter of the horses&rsquo; hoofs,
which was the only perceptible noise, my mind
flew across the few leagues that separated me
from my dear quaint old native town, cradled
there to the south at the foot of two hills, each
crowned by a tiny church. I saw its streets
meeting at right angles, its two streams,
dubbed rivers, parched with thirst, crawling
under the ancient arched Spanish bridges, its
low houses, with their enclosing <i>patios</i> planted
with roses and flowers that bloom all the year
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
round, with fountains murmuring in the midst,
and creepers covering the columns and the
ceilings of the open corridors, and then climbing
out of sight; the numerous churches, each
one with its familiar legend; the convents&mdash;solid,
spacious&mdash;turned into barracks or public
offices or colleges; the still old cells desecrated,
their dividing walls torn down so as to convert
the space into large halls, and, ruthless iconoclasm
having carried away the statues of the
saints, no other trace of religion left but a stone
cross, or a carved saint&rsquo;s face set too high above
ground to be reached by irreverent hands.</p>
<p>Yes, there was the little Church of Holy
Humility&mdash;El Humilladero&mdash;an <i>adobe</i> structure,
a mere hut, yet reverenced beyond words
as being, so tradition said, the first church built
in the land. And not far from it the Church of
la Tercera and its convent, about which gruesome
tales were told. Its monks never slept
on mattresses, and, as they felt death approaching,
would have themselves placed upon the
ground to die close to their Mother Earth; and
one of them, it was said, for some misdeameanour
or possibly greater fault, had committed suicide,
and wandered headless&mdash;people had seen him&mdash;on
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
dark and stormy nights through the
neighbouring street of the Arch, as it was
called, though of the arch nothing but the
memory remained. And close to that convent
of la Tercera was the other one of the jolly
Franciscan Fathers, four beautiful <i>patios</i> surrounded
with broad cloisters, into which opened
over 600 cells, each provided, besides the
sitting and sleeping room, with a snug kitchen,
old Moorish style, an open hearth for charcoal
fire, on which meats were roasted and earthenware
saucepans simmered and purred all day
long, extracting the juice from beef, mutton,
plantains, ma&ntilde;oc, green corn, potatoes, and the
other numerous vegetables of that region,
forming a most substantial broth, a peculiarly
rich <i>pot-au-feu</i> which enabled the reverend
monks to recruit their strength and spirits after
the pious labours of the day; and with this
came, it is said, a copious supply of that beer,
<i>chicha</i>, brewed from molasses and Indian corn,
strong and delicious&mdash;to those who like it.
These reverend monks, it is said, owned broad
lands and numerous herds, and each had a
lay brother who looked after the material wants
of his superior, and received daily rations
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
sufficient for ten or twenty men, so that a
great part of them was sold by the monks
to the profane outside the cloister walls. As
the lay brother looked after all these worldly
interests, he enabled the monk to devote his
whole time and attention to finding a smooth
path to heaven, not only for himself, but for as
many others of his fellow-creatures as he met.</p>
<p>But though of good cheer, they were not
lacking in piety, nor were they unable to withstand
temptation. Their church was beautiful,
all full of gilt columns, carved woodwork,
niches with statues of saints displaying rich
silks and gems and gold embroidery.</p>
<p>And though many of these things had
disappeared in my day, and of the monks only
a few more vital spirits survived, downcast and
forlorn, lamenting the good old times, yet
enough remained to give an idea of the happier
age.</p>
<p>A proof of the virtue of the monks was
visible at the entrance of the church looking on
the main street, where the Evil One himself
had branded it, so to say, for the greater glory
of God and the renown of the convent.</p>
<p>It was whispered that Father Antonio,
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
who combined profane accomplishments with
spiritual insight, skilled in playing the guitar,
not averse to a song or two, fond of cards for a
friendly quiet game with the Father Superior
and two or three other plump, kind-hearted
brethren, where small sums were staked merely
to give zest to the game, discovered to his
horror one night that the Evil One, possibly in
memory of his namesake (the monk&rsquo;s, not the
Evil One&rsquo;s), had decided to tempt his virtue,
and appeared in his cell in the guise of a
beautiful damsel.</p>
<p>Alas! the Evil One had reckoned without
his host. Holy water was poured upon him,
the cross with the Redeemer nailed on it
which lay handy was taken up by Antonio, so
that Beelzebub in his fright jumped out of the
window with such force that his cloven foot left
its imprint upon the granite slab outside the
church, and this imprint I saw myself in my very
young years. Although many people continue
to see it, I have grown so short-sighted that,
strive as I may, the stone now appears untouched
and like the others. But then these
things will happen, and they certainly should
not lead us to doubt so pious a tradition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>And so all the old memories of the town kept
passing before me. I saw a living panorama,
silent, bathed in mysterious light, moving
slowly in the background of the mind, large,
infinite in its magnitude, with space in it for
men and buildings and mountains and rivers
and broad plains and leafy forests, and, what is
more, with space in it for Time, the boundless
Time that contains all and everything.</p>
<p>Schooldays, holidays spent in the neighbouring
towns and villages which lie in the warmer
valleys, my first voyage to a certain distance,
and then across the ocean&mdash;life, in fact, with its
ebb and flow under various suns and in
different continents&mdash;all came back; but it were
out of place to give my reflections on them here.</p>
<p>Then, pausing for one moment as a bird alights
on the mast of a ship before launching forth
into mid-ocean, my mind rested for an instant
on the old cemetery where so many loved ones
slumbered. Alas! when we leave the graves of
those whom we have loved, not knowing when
we shall again kneel upon the sod that covers
them, we feel that death itself has not severed
the link that bound us to those who were blood
of our blood and bone of our bone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>A little geography may not be amiss here.
A glance at the map will show that the city of
Bogot&aacute; is situated upon a vast plateau, at an
altitude of about 8,500 feet above sea-level,
4 degrees from the equator, and 75 degrees
to the west of Greenwich. Its position in
the continent is central. It is perched like a
nest high up in the mountains. To reach the
ocean, and thus the outer world, the inhabitants
of Bogot&aacute; are even now still compelled to have
recourse to quite primitive methods; true, there
are some apologies for railways starting northward,
southward and westward, but in some
cases their impetus ends as soon as they
reach the end of the plain, and in others long
before attaining that distance. Once the
railway journey finished&mdash;which does not exceed
two or three hours on any of the lines&mdash;the
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
traveller has to content himself with the
ancient and slow method of riding, mostly mule
riding. The ground is so broken and the roads
are so bad that horses could not cross them as
safely as that thoughtful, meditative, and much-maligned
animal the mule. After covering a
distance of some ninety to one hundred miles
westward, the traveller reaches the town of
Honda, which lies on the Magdalena River.
Here steam-boats are to be found, stern-wheeled,
shallow-bottomed, drawing no more than from
2&frac12; to 3 feet, in which, within four or five days,
he makes the journey down to the sea-coast.</p>
<p>The map of the country would seem to show
that the easiest way from the capital to the
ocean would be towards the Pacific, and as the
crow flies such is the case; but between Bogot&aacute;
and the Pacific Ocean the Andes, at some
period of their youth, must have frolicked and
gambolled amongst themselves and lost their
way home, so that they now form the most
rugged country imaginable. Geographers,
with that thirst for classification that afflicts&mdash;or
should I rather say animates?&mdash;men of science,
speak of two or three chains of mountains.
The average man, however, who has to travel
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
over that country, conceives his task as corresponding
to a start made from one end of a huge
comb, following the developments of it from the
root to the point of each tooth until Providence
and Nature take pity on him, and land him, so
to speak, on the sea-shore.</p>
<p>Bogot&aacute; is no thoroughfare. When you get
there, there you are, and if you go there, it is
because you were bent on it; it is not like
other towns that may be on the road to somewhere
else, so that travellers may chance to
find themselves there.</p>
<p>The plateau of Bogot&aacute; proper was formerly&mdash;no
one knows how many centuries or thousands
of years ago&mdash;a lake of about eighty square
miles encased between the surrounding mountains.
The waters of the lake broke through
the barrier of mountains towards the south,
draining it, and leaving the plateau dry, save
for some small lakes that dot it here and there,
and a few rivers of no great importance. I
could not help thinking that this immense
lake thus held aloft upon that mighty pedestal
at such an altitude formed a sort of gigantic
goblet such as is rarely seen under the sun.
The river that marks the course through which
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
the waters are supposed to have been drained
drags its sluggish waves meandering in many
turns and twists from north to south along the
plain, and gives a sudden leap of 750 feet
through the open gap on the mountain-side,
forming those magnificent waterfalls called the
Tequendama. The river plunges headlong, as
if to make up for its previous semi-stagnant
condition; it disappears between two mighty
walls of stone, polished as if chiselled by the
hand of man; it roars with a deafening sound;
its waters appear, as they curl over the abyss,
white as the wool of a lamb, and their consistency
conveys the impression of wool rather
than that of snow. The morning sun plays
upon the mass of waters, and crowns it with a
halo of rainbows varying in size. On the
borders of the river, at the place where the
cataract springs, are to be seen evergreens and
pine-trees, and other such plants belonging to
the temperate or cold zones; down below,
where the water falls, and the river reappears
like a dying stream following its course in the
lower valley, palm-trees and tropical vegetation
are to be seen, and birds of variegated plumage,
parrots, cockatoos, parroquets and others, fly
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
like living arrows from the sunlight, and plunge
into the mist with piercing shrieks amidst the
deafening roar of the cataract.</p>
<p>As we journeyed on in the cool night air, it
seemed to me that the whole country&mdash;north,
south, east and west&mdash;lay at my feet, and to the
mind&rsquo;s eye it appeared with its vast interminable
plains to the east crossed by numberless rivers,
the mountain region to the north on the western
side of the Magdalena Valley, the broad plains
in the Lower Magdalena, and the rugged
mountainous district of Antioquia on the
western side of the river, and then mountains
and more mountains towards the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Surely, if a journey in these days presents
such difficulties, the first journey undertaken by
the conquerors who discovered the plateau
of Bogot&aacute;, may be held for a feat worthy of
those men who, whatever their faults, were
brave among the bravest.</p>
<p>Towards the east of the Magdalena River, on
the coast of the Atlantic, the city of Santa
Marta had been founded somewhere in 1530.
News of the vast empire alleged to exist in the
interior of the country had reached the founders
of the town, and they soon decided to conquer
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
that region about which such marvels were told.
In the month of August, 1536, an expedition
of 700 soldiers, infantry, and 80 horse left
Santa Marta to penetrate into the heart of the
continent, confident in their courage, and
lusting for gold and adventure. This part of
the expedition marched by land, and 200 more
men journeyed in boats along the river
Magdalena.</p>
<p>A full narrative of their adventures would be
long. They met foes large and small, from
poisonous reptiles and the numerous insects
which made life a burden, to tigers and
alligators: add to these fevers and illnesses
absolutely unknown to them. It is said that
one man, whilst sleeping in camp with all his
companions, was snatched from his hammock
by a famished tiger. At times the rank and
file seemed ripe for mutiny, but the captain was
a man of iron. His name was Gonzalo Jim&eacute;nez
de Quesada. Though himself sore smitten by
some disease peculiar to the locality, he kept the
lead, and dragged the rest in his train. Praise
is likewise due to the chaplain of the expedition,
Domingo de las Casas, who stoutly supported
the commander. This friar was a kinsman of
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
that other friar Bartolom&eacute; de las Casas, whose
unwearying efforts in behalf of the native races
won for him the well-deserved name of &lsquo;Protector
of the Indians.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a while the boats and the shores of the
great river were abandoned, and the men found
themselves in a mountainous country where the
temperature became more tolerable and pleasant
as they climbed higher. Finally, their eyes
beheld the Empire of the Chibchas. What a
joy&mdash;after toil and suffering which had lasted
over seventeen months, when only 160 of the
original expedition were left&mdash;to gaze upon a
land where cultivated fields were seen in all
directions, and the hearth-smoke rising from
the houses to heaven! This was the land of
the Chibchas, who formed an empire second
only to that of the Incas of Peru and the
Aztecs of Mexico. They had a religion&mdash;by
no means a bad one as religions went amongst
the American aborigines&mdash;they had their code
of laws, their division of time, their rules
and codes in all matters appertaining to
family life and administration of government;
they tilled the soil, they believed in the immortality
of the soul, they reverenced their
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
dead, and practised barter according to well-defined
laws.</p>
<p>The thousands and thousands of soldiers
which the Zipa or King of the Chibchas could
bring against the Spaniards were overawed
rather than overcome by force. The greater
sagacity of the Spaniards, coupled with their
courage, soon made them masters of the land.
Jim&eacute;nez de Quesada founded the city of Bogot&aacute;
in 1537. He chose a spot on the plains which
suited him&mdash;where the city now stands&mdash;and,
clad in full armour, surrounded by his companions
and by a large crowd of Indians,
plucked some grass from the ground, and,
unsheathing his sword, declared that he took
possession of the land for the greater glory of
God as the property of his King and master,
Charles V. of Spain. Then turning, with a
fierce glance, to those who surrounded him, he
challenged one and all to single combat should
they dare to dispute his action. Naturally, no
dispute arose, and so the title was acquired.
They had their own peculiar ways, those old
Spanish conquerors! A similar method was
followed by Nu&ntilde;ez de Balboa, when, in the
name of his King and master, he took possession
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
of the Pacific Ocean with whatever lands
and islands might border on it, stepping into
the waters clad in full armour, holding the flag
of Spain in his left hand, and his trusty Toledo
blade&mdash;<i>la de Juanes</i>&mdash;in his right.</p>
<p>To speak of this conquest of the Chibcha
Empire recalls the fact that the land of Bogot&aacute;
was really the land of El Dorado. <i>El Dorado</i>
in Spanish means the gilt one, the man covered
with gold, and all chroniclers and historians of
the early period are agreed as to the origin of
the tradition.</p>
<p>The King of the Chibchas, amongst whom
power and property passed by law of inheritance
from uncle to nephew, was called the
Zipa. His power as a monarch was absolute,
but to attain the dignity of what we should
nowadays call Crown Prince, and to become
in due course King, it was not enough to be a
nephew, or even to be the right nephew. The
prospective heir to the throne had to qualify
himself by passing through an ordeal which
Princes of other nations and other times would
certainly find most obnoxious. He had to live
in a cave for six years, fasting the whole time,
with limited rations, barely enough to sustain
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
life. No meat or salt were to be eaten during
the whole time. He must see no one, with the
exception of his male servants, nor was he even
allowed to gaze upon the sun. Only after sunset
and before sunrise might he issue from his
cave. After this ordeal he was qualified, but
should he have so much as cast his eyes upon
a woman during that period, his rights to
the throne were lost. The consecration, so to
speak, of the Zipa took the form of a most
elaborate ceremony. The prospective Zipa
would betake himself&mdash;being carried upon a
special sort of frame so arranged that twenty
men standing under it could lift it upon their
shoulders&mdash;to one of the five sacred lakes that
still exist in the plateau, generally to the lake
of Guatavita. There, stripped naked, his body
was smeared with a resinous substance, upon
which gold-dust was sprinkled in large quantities.
Naturally, after this process the man
appeared like unto a very statue of gold. Two
other high dignitaries or chiefs, called Caciques,
as nude as the Zipa, would go with him upon a
raft of twisted reeds and slowly paddle into the
centre of the lake. All round the shore was a
dense crowd, burning a species of aromatic herb
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
which produced clouds of smoke. On every
hand was heard the sound of music, or, rather,
of noises representing the music customary
at all ceremonies. On the raft, at the feet of
the Zipa, lay a huge pile of gold and emeralds.
Each of his companions, too, had gold and
emeralds, wherewith to propitiate the god in
whose honour the ceremony was performed.
One of the chiefs in the raft would raise a
white flag and wave it. The noise on the
shores became deafening, whilst the gilded
Zipa threw into the lake all the gold and all
the emeralds; then his companions would
follow his example. When all the gold and
emeralds on the raft had been cast into the
lake, the people ashore also made their offerings
of gold. Thus, after six years&rsquo; fasting, the
Zipa was (so to put it) anointed or qualified for
kingship. On reaching the land the period of
abstinence came to an end, and now that the
Zipa was full-fledged Crown Prince, or Zipa
(if his predecessor should have chanced to die),
his first act was to get gloriously drunk.</p>
<p>From the early days of the conquest, efforts
were made to drain the five lakes, from which
numerous samples of gold idols and roughly-worked
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
gold have been recovered. Even recently
a company was formed in England for
that purpose. The tradition in this case being
so universal, it seems rational to assume that
vast treasures must lie at the bottom of these
lakes, because the Chibchas were an ancient
race, and their ceremonies must have been
repeated during centuries. The country also
is rich in emeralds and in gold&mdash;hence the
belief in the large amount of treasure to be
obtained from those lakes whose waters look so
placid.</p>
<p>Some years ago in Bogot&aacute; an enthusiast,
who sought to form a company for the purpose
of draining one of the lakes, carried about with
him a few samples of gold, idols and suchlike,
which, so he said, had been brought to light
by a man whom he named, a good diver, who
plunged five times into the lake, and after
each plunge brought up one of the specimens
exhibited. He argued thus: The bottom of
the lake must be practically studded with gold,
since Mr. X. succeeded each time. There are
millions in the lake, and all that is needed is a
little money to drain it.</p>
<p>The argument seemed so strong, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
gold gleamed so bright in his hands, that he
obtained numerous subscribers, until he had the
misfortune to come across one of those sceptics
impervious to reason, who, after listening to
him, replied: &lsquo;Yes, I have no doubt that there
must be millions in the lake, since X. at each
plunge brought out a bit of gold like those you
show me; but what I cannot for the life of me
understand is why he is not still plunging&mdash;it
seems so easy!&rsquo; The tale went round the
town, and the lake was not drained, nor has
it been up to the present.</p>
<p>This gilding of the man is the germ of the
legend of El Dorado, which has cost so
much blood, and in search of which so
many thousands and thousands of men have
wandered during past centuries in all possible
directions on their bootless quest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>Returning to the lake, and now gathering the
information furnished by geology, whose silent
annals are so carefully and truthfully recorded
(being as they are beyond reach of man&rsquo;s
little contentions and petty adjustments), we
find that the original lake covered an area of
about seventy-five square miles, and attained
great depths. Its placid waters, beating possibly
for centuries against the environing rocks, have
left their marks, from which it may be seen
that in some places the depth was 120 feet, and
in others 180.</p>
<p>We cannot fix the date of the break in the
mountains which allowed the drain to occur.
So far man has not succeeded in grasping with
invariable accuracy the chronology of the admirable
geological archives to which we have
referred, and in matters of this kind a discrepancy
of a few hundred years more or less is
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
accepted as a trifle scarcely worth mentioning.
And possibly this may be right. For man&rsquo;s
passage through life is so short that his conception
of time cannot be applied to Nature,
whose evolutions, though apparently protracted
and very slow to see, in truth are sure to
develop themselves harmoniously in every way,
as to time inclusive.</p>
<p>But no matter how far back the draining of
the great lake may have taken place, it had
left its memory and impression, not only on
the mountains and the rocks, but also in the
minds of men. The legend ran thus: At one
time there came among the Chibchas a man
differing in aspect from the inhabitants of the
plateau, a man from the East, the land where
the sun rises, and from the low plains where
the mighty rivers speed to the ocean. He had
taught them the arts of peace, the cultivation
of the soil, the division of time; he had established
their laws, the precepts by which their
life was to be guided, their form of government;
in one word, he had been their apostle
and legislator. His name was Bochica or
Zuhe. He resembled in aspect the Europeans
who invaded the country under Quesada.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>It is asserted by a pious Spanish Bishop, who
in the middle of the seventeenth century wrote
the history of the discovery and conquest of
the Chibcha kingdom, that the said Bochica was
none other than the Apostle St. Bartholomew,
as to whose final work and preachings there is
(not to overstate the case) some obscurity. The
good old Bishop states that, as the Christian
faith, according to the Divine decree, was to
be preached in every corner of the earth, it
must have also been preached amongst the
Chibchas, and that, as nothing was known with
certainty about the final whereabouts of the
Apostle Bartholomew, and he was not unlike
the description made of Bochica by the Chibchas
(which, by-the-by, was such that it might
have fitted any white man with a long blonde
beard), it is evident that the saint must have
visited those Andine regions. Furthermore,
he adds, there is a stone on one of the mountains,
situated between the plateau of Bogot&aacute;
and the eastern plains, which bears the footprints
of the saint. This, to many people, is
decisive, and I, for my part, am not going
to gainsay it, since it serves two important
ends. It explains the saint&rsquo;s whereabouts in
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
a most creditable and appropriate fashion, and
it puts a definite end to all doubts concerning
Bochica&rsquo;s identity. We cannot be too grateful
to those who thus afford pleasant explanations
of matters which would otherwise be intricate and
difficult, perhaps even impossible, of solution.</p>
<p>The legend went on to say that the god of
the Chibchas (Chibchacum), becoming irate at
their excesses and vices, flooded the plain where
they lived, by turning into it several neighbouring
rivers. The inhabitants, or such of
them as were not drowned, took refuge on the
neighbouring mountain-tops, where, animated
by that fervour and love of the Deity which
takes possession of every true believer when
he finds himself thoroughly cornered, they
prayed abundantly to the Bochica, whose precepts
they had utterly forgotten. He, of course,
took pity on them, and, appearing amidst them
on the mountain-top one afternoon in all the
glory of the setting sun, which covered him
as with a sort of royal mantle, he dashed his
golden sceptre against the mighty granite wall
of the nearest mountain, which opened at the
blow into the gap through which the waters
poured, draining the lake, and leaving as a
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
memorial of his power and his love for his chosen
people those waterfalls whose thunder goes up
like a perennial hymn to heaven high above
the trees that crown the mountain-tops, and
whose sprays are as incense for ever, wreathing
on high at the foot of a stupendous altar.</p>
<p>The cataract takes two leaps, first striking
a protruding ledge at a distance of about
75 feet from the starting-point, a sort of
spring-board from which the other mighty
leap is taken. Close to the shore, at a
distance of about 6 feet, on the very brim
of the abyss, there is a rock about 10 feet
square, which, when the waters are low, breaks
the river, and appears like a sinking island in
the mass of foaming waters. The rock is
slippery, being covered with moss, which the
waters and the mists keep constantly wet.
Bolivar, the soldier to whose tenacity and
genius Colombia and four other South American
republics owe their political independence, once
visited the cataracts, and stood on the very
edge of the abyss; glancing fitfully at the
small round island of stone that stood in the
very centre of the waters, fascinated by the
danger, he jumped, booted and spurred as he
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
was, upon the stone, thus standing in the
very vortex of the boiling current. After remaining
there for a few minutes he jumped
back. The tale is interesting, for few men
indeed have the courage and nerve required,
once upon the rock, not to fall from it and
disappear in a shroud fit for any man, however
great.</p>
<p>After the little scene of the foundation of
Bogot&aacute;, in what later on became the public
square of the city, Quesada devoted himself
to establishing a government. I cannot help
thinking that challenges like that which he
flung down for the purpose of establishing
the right of property are, to say the least,
peculiar. True it is that no one contradicted,
and, according to the old proverb, silence gives
consent. A comfortable little tag this, especially
when you can gag the other side! And
a most serviceable maxim to burglars, conquerors,
and, in fact, all such as practise the
art of invading somebody else&rsquo;s premises, and
taking violent possession of the premises and
all that may be found on them. What I cannot
for the life of me understand is, how it is that,
the process being identical in essence, so many
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
worthy men and so many worthy nations punish
the misunderstood burglar, and bestow honours,
praise, and, so far as it lies in their power,
glory, upon the conqueror. It seems a pity that
the gentle moralists who act in this puzzling
fashion have not found time to indicate the
point, in the process of acquiring somebody
else&rsquo;s property by violence and bloodshed, when
the vastness of the undertaking transfigures
crime into virtue. The average man would
hold it for a boon if those competent to do
it were to fix the limit, just as in chemistry
a freezing or a boiling point is marked by a
certain number of degrees of heat. What a
blessing it would be for the rest of us poor
mortals, who find ourselves beset by many
doubts, and who through ignorance are prone
to fall into grave errors! but as these hopes
are certainly beyond fulfilment, and are possibly
out of place, it is better to drop them.</p>
<p>Quesada, after vanquishing the Chibchas and
becoming lord of the land, did not have it all
his own way. The fame of El Dorado existed
all over the continent. Though peopled by
numerous tribes, mostly hostile to each other,
some knowledge of the power of the Chibcha
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
Empire, covering over 5,000 square miles and
including a population estimated at over a
million and a half of inhabitants, had in the
course of centuries slowly permeated to very
remote parts of what is now known as South
America. In the land of Quito, situated below
the equator, it is said that the conquerors who
had invaded it heard from an Indian of the
wonderful El Dorado. The Indian&rsquo;s tale must
have been enhanced with all the charms invented
by a vivid imagination, playing safely
at a distance. This set many of the conquerors
on the road to Bogot&aacute;. Don Sebastian de
Belalc&aacute;zar, who had entered the continent by
the Pacific, led his troops&mdash;not over 200
in number at the end of the journey&mdash;to the
Bogot&aacute; plateau, thus making a march of
several hundred leagues across forest and
mountains, attracted by the renown of the land
of El Dorado. Another expedition which had
entered the continent by the north-east coast
of the Atlantic, and had wandered along the
Orinoco Valley for over two years, eventually
found itself near the plateau, and entered it,
so that, shortly after his arrival into the country
and his conquest of it, Quesada found himself
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
confronted with two powerful rivals. For the
moment there was great danger that the
conquerors might come to blows amongst
themselves, but Quesada&rsquo;s political ability
matched his military gifts, and arrangements
were soon made by which the three expeditions
were merged into one, gold and emeralds
distributed amongst the soldiers, numerous
offices created, taxes established, the Indians
and their belongings distributed amongst the
Christian conquerors, and the reign of civilization
established to the greater glory of God,
and that of his beloved monarch, the King of
all the Spains.</p>
<p>One detail deserves mention as an instance
of tenacious though unpretending heroism.
The men who had come along the Orinoco
had wandered for many weary months, and at
times had been on the point of starvation,
so that all their leather equipment had been
devoured. With the expedition marched a
friar who carried with him a fine Spanish cock
and four hens. During that long journey,
which cost the lives of so many men, the
murderous attempts made against this feathered
family were past counting; yet the useful birds
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
were saved, and formed the basis of an innumerable
progeny in the land of Colombia.
The incident seems trivial, but, if well weighed,
the friar&rsquo;s sustained effort against others, and
doubtless against himself, to save the precious
germ, deserves the highest praise.</p>
<p>After months of hunger, when the plenty
found on the plateau had restored equanimity
to the hearts of the conquerors, they must have
felt how much they owed to the good friar,
who, even if his sermons&mdash;about which I know
nothing&mdash;may not have been of the best, had
left behind him the hens to lay the egg so dear
to civilized man, and the chanticleer to sing the
praises of the Almighty and to remind everyone
in this instance of the humble beings who serve
Him and their fellow-creatures in such a practical
way.</p>
<p>It is not at all strange that the Spanish
conquerors swallowed the wonderful tales of
incalculable treasure to be found in different
parts of the continent which they had just
discovered. Columbus himself, in his second
voyage, landed at Veraguas on the mainland,
and reaped a most bountiful harvest of gold.
Never before in the history of Spanish wars
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
had such booty fallen to the lot of the common
soldier as in that instance. Other expeditions
in various parts of the continent were equally
fortunate, so that they supported the belief that
gold was inexhaustible. The ostensible object
of the conquest was the conversion of the
infidels to the true faith; officially the Government
of the Metropolis proclaimed first and
foremost its intense desire to save the souls
of so many million men who groped in the
darkness of heathenism. Doubtless many of
the conquerors really thought that they were
doing the work of God, but the great majority
of them were certainly moved by more worldly
ends and attractions.</p>
<p>The Indians, on their side, not only in
Colombia but everywhere else, received the
Spaniards in a friendly and hospitable way.
Some warlike tribes there were, but it does
not appear that their hostilities against the
Spaniards began before these had shown their
cruel greed and insatiable thirst for gold. The
precious metals and jewels that had been accumulated
amongst the tribes in the course of
many generations were given freely to the
Spaniards, who, believing that greater treasures
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
were kept back from them, did not hesitate
to recur to the cruellest methods of extortion,
burning, pillaging, killing, and destroying everything
in their way.</p>
<p>After a struggle which did not last long, the
Indians&mdash;even those of riper civilization and
better organized&mdash;were completely subdued,
and the sway of the Spaniard established all
over the land, whose former lords became the
slaves of the conquerors.</p>
<p>Those who know the Indian of to-day in
certain parts of the South American continent
can hardly understand how at one time that
same race possessed the qualities indispensable
to the civilization which it had attained at the
time of the Spanish conquest. Boiling the
whole thing down to hard facts, we find that
the Spaniards discovered a land wherein they
found a people with civilization inferior to that
of the old world; that this people, divided and
subdivided in many tribes, received the conquerors
hospitably, treated them generously,
and in their ignorance considered them as
superior beings; that they gave over to the
Spaniards all the gold and treasures which the
latter coveted, and that it would have been
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
feasible for those superior beings to establish
the civilization and the religion which they
longed to propagate amongst the infidels, by
methods worthy of the Christian faith which
they professed. Instead of this, violence and
bloodshed were the only methods employed,
not to civilize, but to despoil the natives; and
the right of force, brutal and sanguinary, was
the law of the land. To this and its accompaniments
the poets lifted up p&aelig;ans of praise,
the Church gave its blessing, history its acceptance,
and, barring a handful of the just, no one
gave a thought to the oppressed and helpless
Indians whose sole crime was they were weaker
than their aggressors.</p>
<p>Let us be thankful for what we have.
Quintana, the great Spanish lyrical poet, pondering
on these misdeeds and crimes, exclaims
that they were crimes of the epoch, not of
Spain. Fortunately it is, as we like to think,
our privilege to live in an epoch when such
things are impossible, when the mere thirst
for gold, or its equivalent, cannot impel powerful
nations to forget right and justice and to proclaim
hypocritically that in so doing they are
fulfilling the law of Him who said, &lsquo;Love ye
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
one another,&rsquo; and proclaimed charity amongst
men as the supreme rule of life. Nowadays
such wrongs as those perpetrated by the Spanish
conquerors could not happen. Wars we have,
and violence and destruction, and malcontents
complain of them, saying that the same old
burglarious spirit of brutal greed is the real
cause of those wars; but those malcontents
should not be (and, in fact, are not) listened
to. I myself do not understand or pretend to
explain where the justice of many wars comes
in, but certainly they must be waged for good
and honest ends, because the great and the
powerful say that the ends are good and
honest, that civilization and Christianity are
served thereby; and it must be so since they
say it, for they, like Brutus, are &lsquo;honourable
men.&rsquo; Let us be thankful, then, that we live
in an age of justice and universal fairness
amongst men!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>But let us go back to our subject.</p>
<p>All this time we journeyed on. The stars
had kept their watch above our heads, and
the moon, as if passing in review the various
quarters of heaven, had been moving from west
to east, and was very high on the horizon.
We were chilled through after the night&rsquo;s ride,
longing to arrive at some wayside inn or <i>venta</i>
where we might get something warm. The
dawn was heralded in the far east by a broad
streak of light, which grew rapidly, covering
that side of the horizon like a fan, and soon
bursting into glorious daylight. In equatorial
regions there is hardly any dawn or
twilight; in those latitudes there is no prelude
of semi-obscurity that either waxes into day
or wanes slowly into the dark, like the note
of the lute, falling into silence so faintly and
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
softly that none can tell the exact moment
when it dies. At evening the sun sinks to
the verge of the horizon, and disappears like
a luminous orb dropped into empty space, and
darkness sets in almost immediately. In the
mountainous lands his last rays crown the
highest peaks with a halo of glory, when
darkness has settled over the valleys and
mountain flanks. The moment the sun sets
the stars assert their empire, and they are
more numerous to the eye than anywhere
else in the world. As for the moon, I have
already spoken of its brilliancy. Another
phenomenon connected with it is worthy of
notice in our special case. During the various
months of the trip which I am now describing,
it seems to me that we had a full moon every
night. I know that this is not quite in accordance
with the established rules, or what in
modern parlance is sometimes called the
schedule of time for lunar service, but I am
narrating my impressions, and, according to
them, such is the fact. I should suggest that,
as everything in Spanish lands is more or less
topsy-turvy at times, the rules applicable to the
moon in well-regulated countries do not hold
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
good there, but I remember just in time that
these irregularities apply solely to things human
that happen &lsquo;tiles downwards,&rsquo; as the Spaniards
say, and cannot, therefore, affect the phenomena
of Nature. As an explanation must be found
for my permanent moon, an acceptable compromise
would be that the ordinary moon did
duty on its appointed nights, leaving the others&mdash;during
which we wandered over mountain,
through valley and forest, and on the waters of
the silent rivers&mdash;to be illuminated for our own
special benefit by some deputy moon, for
whose services we were then, and still are,
most grateful.</p>
<p>As to the topsy-turviness of things Spanish
and Spanish-American, the story is told that
Santiago, the patron saint of Spain, being
admitted into the presence of God, asked and
obtained for the land of Spain and for its people
all sorts of blessings: marvellous fertility for the
soil, natural wealth of all kinds in the mountains
and the forests, abundance of fish in the rivers
and of birds in the air; courage, sobriety, and
all the manly virtues for men; beauty, grace,
loveliness, for the women. All this was granted,
but, on the point of leaving, the saint, it is said,
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
asked from God that he would also grant Spain
a good government. The request was denied,
as then, it is said, the Lord remarked, the
angels would abandon heaven and flock to
Spain. The story has lost none of its point
even at the present day.</p>
<p>With the morning we reached the longed-for
<i>venta</i>, a square, thatch-roofed hut, which stood
by the roadside quite close to the mountain-range
which we had reached after crossing the
whole breadth of the plateau. Outside stood
several pack-horses and mules, tied to the
columns and waiting for their loads. Under
the roof the space was divided into three
rooms, one of them provided with a counter
and shelves running along the sides of the
walls, whereon bottles of various sizes and
contents were exhibited, and where <i>chicha</i>, the
national drink, was served to thirsty travellers.
The middle room was what might be called
the sitting, waiting, sleeping, and dining room
all in one, and the other was the kitchen. The
fire was built on the ground, several logs
burning brightly in the open air, filling the
room with smoke and heat, On three stones&mdash;the
traditional stones of the first hearth&mdash;a
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
saucepan was seen in full boil. In the parlour
we saw several <i>peones</i>, or labourers, from the
highlands on their way to the coffee estates to
help in the harvest. Behind the counter, the
<i>ventera</i>, barmaid and landlady all in one,
buxom and wreathed in smiles, was already
filling either the <i>totuma</i>, a large bowl cut
from a gourd, containing about a quart of
<i>chicha</i>, or the small glass of native whisky
(<i>aguardiente</i>).</p>
<p>We jumped from our horses and entered the
so-called sitting-room, envying the men who
slept deep and strong as virtue on the bare
ground. In a few minutes Fermin had brought
from our saddle-bags the copper kettle used
for making chocolate, and the paste for the
preparation of that delicious drink. Within
twenty minutes of our arrival we had before
us the steaming cups of chocolate which had
been boiled three times, in accordance with the
orthodox principle which lays it down that this
must be done if it is to be rightly done; it
was well beaten and covered with that foam
peculiar to chocolate brewed in hot water, which
looks at you with its thousand eyes or bubbles
that burst as the liquor is imbibed. Never
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
was a cup of chocolate more welcome. The
night seemed to have been interminable now
that it lay behind. We would fain have
stretched ourselves on the ground with the
labourers, but to reach our destination that day
it was necessary to lose no time; so after an
hour&rsquo;s rest, during which our horses had had
their <i>pienso</i> of fodder, we started again, now
over more broken country, leaving the plain
behind us, climbing and descending the road
which was still available for carts and wheeled
vehicles of all sorts.</p>
<p>And thus we advanced, seeing the sunrise
darting its slanting rays, which were quite
pleasant to feel in the early morning, until they
became perpendicular, hot, and almost unbearable
in the dusty road.</p>
<p>The horses, after the long journey, slackened
their pace, and we looked upon surrounding
Nature with weary eyes and that emptiness of
feeling in the brain, that consciousness of a
void somewhere, which always follow nights
passed absolutely without sleep.</p>
<p>Towards four in the afternoon, after seventeen
hours&rsquo; steady ride, interrupted only by the
short stay at the roadside <i>venta</i>, we reached
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
the <i>hacienda</i> of Gambita, where one of our
companions, Raoul, who had started ahead to
prepare everything for the longer journey,
was waiting for us. He came up quite briskly
along the road, joyful at our arrival, full of
spirits, and most anxious that the journey
should be continued. He might well feel thus,
as he had not passed a sleepless night on
horseback like a knight-errant over field and
moor. The desire for sleep and rest was
overpowering&mdash;all else lacked interest for us;
so that, alighting from our horses, we walked
into the house, and, finding convenient sofas,
stretched ourselves and slept. Like Dante
after listening to the sorrowful tale of Francesca,
we fell as a dead body falls, which goes
to prove that identical effects may arise from
totally different causes. Towards ten at night
Raoul waked us. The supper waiting for us
was quickly despatched, and our mules were
saddled and ready.</p>
<p>As I have said before, mules are far preferable
to horses when travelling on the mountain-paths,
which are called roads in the Andes.
The old Shakespearian query, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s in a
name?&rsquo; and the answer that a rose would
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
smell as sweet even if called by another name,
demonstrates the elasticity of words. To the
average Englishman a road is a well-defined
means of communication with or without rails,
but offering all sorts of advantages for comfortable
locomotion. Roads in the Andes at
times are such as to invite the formation of
legends. It is said that an American diplomatist,
visiting a South American republic,
alighted from the river steamer which had
borne him far inland by the respective river,
and was shown the mountain-road which he had
to follow to reach the capital&mdash;a yellowish or
reddish streak like a gash in the mountain,
lying on its side like a rope carelessly thrown
from the summit towards the base, following
the sinuosities of the ground&mdash;and straightway
remarked, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m off home; this road is only fit
for birds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On such roads the mule is the best friend of
man. Had Richard III. found himself in the
plight we all know of in some such locality,
the generous offer of bartering his kingdom
(which, by-the-by, at that moment was a
minus quantity to him) would have made for
a mule instead of for a horse, and although the
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
phrase&mdash;&lsquo;A mule! a mule! my kingdom for
a mule!&rsquo;&mdash;sounds comical (for these are questions
of habit), probably the stock phrase would
bring down the house with laughter. If the
camel is called the ship of the desert, the
mule deserves the title of the balloon of the
mountains.</p>
<p>A friend of mine, knowing of my intended
trip, had sent me his favourite mule, and well
did the animal deserve the praises that its
owner bestowed upon it; patient, sure-footed,
collected, it carried me by precipice, ravine,
ascended paths only fit for ants as lightly and
carefully as if no weight were on its back. At
the mud ditches which intersected the roads,
and at times reached the proportions of miniature
lakes, often treacherously deep, it would
halt, looking at the waters with its big, ball-shaped,
moist eyes, and no hint of mine,
whether given with spur or whip, could disturb
its equanimity. At the right moment, heedless
of my meddling, it would jump or ford or slide
as circumstances required. At the beginning
of our companionship, during those long days,
I began by endeavouring to have a mind of
my own as to the part of the road to be selected.
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
I soon saw that my efforts were useless, for
that wisdom of the mule which men call
stubbornness was invincible. And, frankly,
it was lucky that I soon gained this conviction,
as certainly the mule knew far better than I
what should be done.</p>
<p>How strange all this sounds in this land of
railroads, automobiles, omnibuses, and wheeled
conveyances of every sort! yet there is more
genuine travelling, more real travelling, in
going from one place to another on the back
of a mule than in being cooped for hours or
days in a railway compartment whirled along
at lightning speed. What does one learn about
the country, what does one see of its beauty
or of its peculiarities, in this latter case? It
may be transportation, it may be locomotion,
but it is not travelling.</p>
<p>If I were a man of ample means, I would
certainly endow that splendid beast which
carried me during so many days, or provide a
pension for it, so that it might spend the
remainder of its life in the enjoyment of
meadows ever green, luscious with rich grass
and sweet with the waters of rippling streams.</p>
<p>From Gambita on, our cavalcade had something
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
of the aspect of a caravan. There were
Alex, Raoul, and myself, besides our servant
Fermin, four muleteers, and ten or twelve mules
laden with our luggage, tents, provisions, arms,
and so forth. This mob of travellers was so
unusual that the simple folks in the villages
through which we passed said that his lordship
the Archbishop was no doubt on a tour. On
hearing this, and finding that the people began
to kneel by the roadside, rather than shatter
their illusion, I&mdash;knowing that I was the most
episcopal-looking of our crowd&mdash;decided to
give my blessing, which I did with due unction
to the kneeling maidens and matrons along the
roadside.</p>
<p>From Gambita we shaped our course eastward.
It was our intention to reach the
Atlantic through the Orinoco River. We were
seeking one of the many affluents of the river
Meta, which is itself one of the largest tributaries
of the Orinoco. The affluents of the Meta
start on the eastern slope of the mountains
which form the plateau of Bogot&aacute;.</p>
<p>After three days&rsquo; ride from Gambita, we
reached the estate of a friend near the town
of Miraflores, where we had to prepare ourselves
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
for the last stage of the land journey
which would carry us through the dense forests
bordering the lower eastern slope of the
Cordilleras, and constituting a sort of fringe
around the endless plains that extend for
thousands of miles from the foot of the Cordilleras
to the ocean. Across these plains flow
the mighty rivers, their numerous affluents, and
the countless <i>ca&ntilde;os</i>, or natural canals connecting
the rivers amongst themselves, and thus forming
a perfect network of natural waterways.</p>
<p>At Miraflores we stopped for twenty-four
hours to recruit our forces and prepare everything,
not only for the last stage of the land
journey, but for the long canoe voyage that lay
before us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>From Miraflores on, the descent was continuous.
Before penetrating into the forest, we skirted
the mountain for a good many miles. The
road, barely 4 or 5 feet in width, had been cut
out of the rock, like the cornice of a temple.
On the one side we had the bluff of the
mountain, and on the other a precipice of
hundreds, and even thousands, of feet in depth.
The inclination at times was so steep that at
a distance the line of the road on the mountain
seemed almost vertical, and the file of mules
with riders or with loads on their backs
appeared like so many flies on a wall.</p>
<p>Up to the time that we reached Miraflores,
we had followed what in Colombia are called,
according to the loyal tradition still living on
the lips, if not in the hearts, of the people,
&lsquo;royal roads,&rsquo; or <i>caminos reales</i>. These royal
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
roads are paths along the mountain slopes, said
to follow the old Indian trails, and the Indians
had a peculiar way of selecting their paths or
trails. They seem to have been impervious to
fatigue, and Franklin&rsquo;s adage, now accepted
the world over, that time is money, did not
obtain with them, for they had no money and
abundant time. When an Indian wanted to
cross a range of mountains, instead of selecting
the lowest summit, he fixed his eye on the
highest peak, and over it would wend his way.
The explanation given is that thus he accomplished
two ends&mdash;crossing the range and
placing himself in a position to see the widest
possible horizon. Be that as it may, the
Spaniards who settled in the colonies accepted
the precedent, and the result is a most
wearisome and unpleasant one in the present
day.</p>
<p>But if as far as Miraflores we had the so-called
&lsquo;royal roads,&rsquo; from thence on in an
easterly direction towards the plain we lacked
even these apologies for roads. From Miraflores
towards the <i>llanos</i>, along the slope of the
Cordilleras, extends an intricate forest in its
primeval state. We had to fight our way
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
through the under-brush amongst the trunks
of the huge trees, and at times really battling
for each foot that we advanced. However, our
guides, who were expert cattle-drivers&mdash;large
quantities of cattle being driven through these
forests from the plains to the uplands&mdash;knew
the forest so well that the obstacles were
reduced to their minimum.</p>
<p>We rode in Indian file, the chief of the
guides ahead of the line cutting with his cutlass,
or <i>machete</i>, the branches and overhanging
boughs, thorns, reeds, creepers, and the like,
that might strike us in the face as we rode
under them. Next to him followed two <i>peones</i>,
who cleared the ground, if necessary, from
fallen branches or stones against which our
mules might stumble. At first this slow mode
of travel was most interesting. The light
scarcely filtered through the dense mass of
leaves, so that we felt as if we stood constantly
behind some cathedral stained-glass window.
The air was full of the peculiar fragrance of
tropical flowers and plants; the orchids swung
high above our heads like lamps from the vaults
of a temple, and the huge trunks of the trees,
covered with creepers studded with multi-coloured
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
flowers, appeared like the festooned
columns of a temple on a feast-day.</p>
<p>However, there were certain drawbacks: the
ground was so wet and spongy that the feet of
the animals sank into it, and progress was
accordingly very slow. Now and then we
would come to a halt, owing to a huge boulder
of rock or large trunk of a tree barring the
passage absolutely. It was then necessary for
the guides to seek the best way of overcoming
the obstacle. Frequently we had to alight
from our mules, as it was dangerous to ride
them in many places. The guides and the
muleteers walked on the uneven ground&mdash;now
stony, and now slippery&mdash;with the agility of
deer, sure-footed and unconscious of the difficulty.
I had to invent a means of advancing:
I placed myself between two of the guides,
hooking one arm to a guide&rsquo;s on each side, and
thus, though frequently stumbling, I never fell,
but it may be readily understood that this mode
of progression was neither comfortable nor
rapid.</p>
<p>Another inconvenience was found in the
thorny bushes, prickly plants, and trees which
it was dangerous to approach, such as the <i>palo</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
<i>santo</i>, so called because it is frequented by a
kind of ant of that name, whose bite is most
painful and induces a slight fever.</p>
<p>On the second day the guide who was ahead
fired his gun, and, on our asking him for the
cause, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only a rattle-snake!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, he had killed a large
specimen, said to be seven years old, as shown
by the seven rattles that were taken from its
tail. These things did not help to make the
ride through the intricate forest more pleasant.
We longed to see the open sky, which we could
only discern through the veil or network of
leaves and branches, and, by a phenomenon of
sympathy between the lungs and the eyes, it
seemed to us that we lacked air to breathe.
Now and then we would come to a clearing,
but we soon plunged again into the thick of it,
and felt like wanderers gone astray in an interminable
labyrinth or maze of tall trees, moist
foliage, and tepid atmosphere.</p>
<p>The guides told us from the start that it
would take from four to five days to reach the
end of the forest. On the fifth day, towards
noon, almost suddenly we came upon the open
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
plain. Our hearts leaped for very joy, and we
hailed the vast green motionless solitude, that
extended far into the horizon before our eyes
like a frozen sea, with a shout of joy. The
trees of the forest stood as in battle-line in front
of the endless plain; the sun darted its rays,
which shimmered in the countless ribbons,
some broader than others, of the silver streams
sluggishly dragging their waves along the
bosom of the unending prairie. Copses of
<i>moriches</i>, an exceptionally graceful species of
palm, dotted the plains in all directions. They
seemed as though planted by the hand of man
to hide behind them a castle, or some old feudal
structure, which our imagination reared complete,
full-fledged, with its walls, its roof, its
turrets, and its legends. The site looked as if
prepared for a large city about to be built, and
waiting only for the arrival of its architects and
inhabitants, even as the white page tarries for
him that is to inscribe upon it a living and
immortal thought.</p>
<p>To continue our journey on the <i>llanos</i>, the
assistance of the guides was even more necessary
than in the thick of the forest. To
attempt travelling on the <i>llanos</i> without expert
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
guides would be like seeking to cross the sea
without a compass.</p>
<p>Once in the <i>llanos</i>, we came within a few
hours to the hamlet of San Pedro, a cattle-trading
station consisting of a few thatch-roofed
houses, almost deserted except during
the various weeks of the year specially fixed
for traders and breeders to meet. Here we
were at last at the end of the first stage of our
journey. It was New Year&rsquo;s Day. Behind
us lay the maze of forest, the meandering trails
and paths, the sheer mountains, the cold fertile
plateau, the native city, and the dead year.
Before us we had the unlimited plain, the
wandering rivers, and there, beyond all, like a
promise, tossing, heaving, roaring, the sea,
vast, immeasurable, the open roadway to the
shores of other lands, some of them free, some
of them perhaps hospitable, all girdled by the
ever-beating waves which now die moaning on
the sands, now dash their fury into foam on the
rocks of the shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>Before parting from our friends the mules, it
may not be amiss to speak of the equipment
for man and beast which obtains in Colombian
Andine regions. The saddle used&mdash;sometimes
native, sometimes European&mdash;offers nothing
striking in its composition, only that it is
provided with a crupper which must be very
strong&mdash;strong as a braced strap&mdash;since in the
steep ascents or descents the girth alone would
be insufficient. The men wear leggings or
<i>zamorros</i>, which, in fact, are rather seatless
trousers than leggings, 2 feet wide, held together
by a strap across the loins, the outside
consisting of tanned hide with the hair on it,
and the inside of soft leather. They have the
advantage of being very easily put on and
slipped off when the rider alights. The
stirrups are a large shoe wherein the whole
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
foot is encased, made of copper or brass. At
first those unfamiliar with the roads find them
awkward, bulky, and heavy, but one soon
learns that they are an indispensable protection,
a sort of armour or shield against the
stones, trees, and sundry other obstacles which
the rider&rsquo;s foot is bound to strike. The <i>poncho</i>,
which is a rectangular piece of woven cotton
cloth about 5 to 6 feet long by 3 to 3&frac12; feet
broad, with a slit in the centre, is worn by
all riders, and a similar piece of india-rubber
cloth, only somewhat larger, is carried strapped
to the back of the saddle to be used when rain
comes on. The real native accoutrement, in
which the saddle differs, having a pommel and
being high-seated in the back, is not complete
without the lasso, made of twisted raw hide, kept
soft and pliable by the frequent use of tallow,
which is rubbed into it. The expert herdsman
can throw the lasso a long distance, either across
the neck of the horses or right over the horns
of the cattle; their aim is unerring. They
fasten the lasso to the pommel of the saddle,
and turn their horses backwards so that they
may better withstand the pull of the lassoed
animal. Spurs in Colombia are frequently
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
worn, especially when you ride somebody else&rsquo;s
hired mule or horse. The spurs are more
formidable in appearance than harmful in
reality; the rollocks, instead of being small
with little pinlike pricks as in Europe, are
huge in size, about 3 inches in diameter, and
each prick about 1&frac12; inches; they make a great
rattle on the slightest provocation, but are less
painful to the animal than the little European
spurs. Apropos of this, I remember the case
of an individual who, finding the Colombian
spurs too heavy, only wore one, arguing that if
he managed to make one side of his mule get
along, the other side would be sure to follow,
and hence only one spur was needed.</p>
<p>On arriving at the wayside <i>venta</i>, or inn&mdash;and
Heaven only knows how elastic a man&rsquo;s
conscience must be to bestow the name of inn
upon many of these <i>ventas</i>&mdash;the first care of
an experienced traveller is to see to the welfare
of his mules and horses. If available, Indian
corn, brown sugar of the species called <i>panela</i>,
which is uncrystallized solidified molasses, and
the best grass that can be got in the neighbourhood,
are given to the animals. If there
happens to be an enclosure, the mules and
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
horses are let loose in it, so that they may rest
more comfortably; but these enclosures are
very frequently a delusion and a snare, as inexperienced
travellers find when, on rising
early in the morning the next day, they are
told that the animals have jumped over the
fence or broken through, or in some other way
disappeared, whereupon the muleteers, with the
boys and men available in the locality pressed
into the service for the occasion, scour the
mountains and the neighbouring forests in
search of the missing animals, the search
lasting at times four and five hours, during
which the traveller frets, foams, and possibly,
if he be quite natural and unspoiled by convention,
swears.</p>
<p>But notwithstanding these drawbacks, there
is a special charm about this mode of travelling.
In the morning about four the traveller arises
from his not too soft couch. The first breakfast
is at once prepared, and whilst it is being
cooked the <i>ma&ntilde;anas</i>, or morning greeting, is
indulged in, consisting of a little whisky,
brandy, <i>aguardiente</i>, rum, or whatever spirits
happen to be available. The hour, even in
the hot lands, is cool. The stars still shine
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
brightly in the heavens, and, were it not for the
testimony of one&rsquo;s watch, one would believe
one&rsquo;s self still in the middle of the night. The
mules are brought forward, given their morning
rations, the luggage is strapped on the &lsquo;cargo&rsquo;
mules, as they are called, and the others are
saddled, and if all goes well, towards five or
half-past, the journey begins.</p>
<p>There is a characteristic odour in the temperate
and low lands of the tropics at that
special hour of morning, and the dawn is
announced by a hum in the ear, which, whilst
it is still dark, is not of birds, but of the
thousand insects that inhabit the forest. Finally,
when the sun bursts forth in all his glory, a hymn
seems to start in all directions, and the mountains
vibrate with echoes of universal animation
from the grass and the bushes, the running
streams, and the nests in the branches of the
trees laden with life. In the cool air of the
morning the mind is quite alert, and the climbing
and descending, the fording of rivers, the
crossing of ravines and precipices, the slow
ascent of the sun in the horizon, the fresh
stirring of the breeze in the leaves, the reverberation
of the light on the drops of fresh dew
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
still hanging from the boughs and dotting the
many-coloured flowers&mdash;all these things induce
such a feeling of communion with Nature that
one feels one&rsquo;s self an integral part of the large,
immense, palpitating life that throbs in every
direction, and the conception of immortality
seems to crystallize, so to speak, in the mind
of the traveller; but, of course, familiarity breeds
contempt, and things beautiful, though they are
a joy for ever, might tire Keats himself through
repetition, so that at times travelling in this
wise often seems slow, and one longs for some
other means of locomotion. Yet I cannot help
thinking with regret of the days when one will
ask for a ticket&mdash;railway, &lsquo;tube,&rsquo; balloon, or
whatever it may be&mdash;from any place on earth
to any other place. When that day arrives,
men will be transported more rapidly from one
place to another, but the real traveller will have
disappeared, as the knight-errant disappeared,
as the gentleman is being driven out from the
world in these days when all things are bought
and sold, and kindness and generosity are
becoming empty words or obsolete relics of
a past that very few understand, and fewer
still care to imitate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>On the very outskirts of the forest, within
half an hour&rsquo;s ride from the long file of trees,
we came upon a group of thatch-roofed structures
which form the so-called town or hamlet
of San Pedro del Tua, a meeting-place, as I
have said before, for herdsmen and dealers,
deserted at the present season; the only persons
who had remained were those whose poverty&mdash;heavier
than any anchor&mdash;had kept them on
the spot away from the Christmas and New
Year&rsquo;s festivities that were being celebrated in
all the towns and villages of the neighbouring
region. Our first care was to find a roof under
which to pass the night. We inquired for the
man in power, namely, the <i>correjidor</i>, a sort of
justice of the peace, mayor, sheriff, all in one,
an official to be found in hamlets or villages
like that which we had just reached. It was
not hard to find him, since there were only
fifteen persons in the place. We had a letter
of introduction to him, which made things
easier. He immediately took us to the best
house in the place, which happened to belong
to him. He asked us what good winds had
wafted us thither, and whither we went. As
we did not care, until having felt our ground
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
a little more, to state frankly that we wanted
to cross into the neighbouring republic of Venezuela,
one of us&mdash;the most audacious if not the
best liar of the lot&mdash;calmly stated that we had
come to the <i>llanos</i> for the purpose of selecting
and purchasing some land, as we intended to
go into the cattle-breeding business, and possibly
into some agricultural pursuit or other.
The <i>correjidor</i> said nothing, but an ironical
smile seemed to flit across his lips. When we
had become more familiar with things and
customs in the plains, we understood why he
had not replied, and the cause of his almost
imperceptible smile. To purchase land in the
<i>llanos</i> would be tantamount to buying salt water
in the midst of the ocean! People &lsquo;squat&rsquo;
wherever they like in those endless plains that
belong to him who exploits them. The cattle,
horses, sheep, are the elements of value to which
ownership is attached, but the grazing lands
belong to one and all, and as matters stand
now, given the scarcity of population and its
slow increase, such will be the condition of
affairs for many a long year to come.</p>
<p>Once inside the house that the <i>correjidor</i> had
placed at our disposal, and feeling more at ease
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
with him, we told him of our intention to go to
Venezuela, and asked for his assistance. His
name was Leal, which means loyal; its sound
had in it the clink of a good omen, and later
events proved that he deserved it. He told us
that our undertaking was by no means an easy
one, nor one that could be accomplished without
the assistance of expert and intelligent
guides. He added that he knew the various
ways to penetrate from Colombia into Venezuela,
and that if we would accept his services
he would accompany us. I need not state that
the offer was accepted with alacrity.</p>
<p>In the short journey from the skirt of the
forest to the hamlet of San Pedro del Tua
across the <i>llano</i> itself, we had time to remark
that its aspect, once in contact with it, was
quite different from the beautiful velvety green
waving in the sunlight, soft and thick, that we
had seen from a distance. The ground was
covered with a coarse grass varying in height
and colour, we were told, according to the
season of the year. A great many small pathways
seemed to cross it in all directions, formed
by the cropping of the grass and the animals
that moved to and fro on the plains. We
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
crossed various <i>ca&ntilde;os</i>, which are natural canals,
uniting the larger rivers. As we were at the
beginning of the dry season, these canals were
low, and we forded them without any difficulty,
but in winter&mdash;that is to say, in the rainy season&mdash;they
attain the dimension of large rivers, and
travelling in the <i>llanos</i> on horseback then
becomes most difficult. We came frequently
upon copses of the <i>moriche</i> palms already
described. In the centre of these copses one
always finds a cool natural basin of water,
which is preferred by the natives as being the
healthiest and the sweetest of the locality&mdash;<i>agua
de morichal</i>. There must be something
in it, for the cattle also prefer this water to that
of the rivers and <i>ca&ntilde;os</i>.</p>
<p>To our inexperienced eye the <i>llanos</i> bore no
landmark which might serve as a guide to our
movements. After a copse of <i>moriche</i> palms
came another one, and then another one, and
no sooner was one <i>ca&ntilde;o</i> crossed than another
took its place, so that without guides it would
have been impossible for us to know whether
we were moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>Leal advised us to lose no time, as the
journey we had before us was a long one.
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
Now that we were close to the beginning of
our canoe journey on the rivers, we at once set
to counting the belongings we had brought at
such great expense and trouble from the high
plateau of Bogot&aacute;, which seemed ever so far
away when with the mind&rsquo;s eye we beheld it
perched like an eagle&rsquo;s nest high up on the
summit of those mountains that it had taken
us about eighteen days to descend. As every
inch of ground that we had left behind had
been, so to say, felt by us, the distance appeared
enormous, and the old city and the plateau
seemed more like the remembrance of a dream
than of a reality. We drew up our inventory,
and found that we were the happy possessors
of about eight cases, 50 pounds in weight
each, containing preserved meats, vegetables,
and food of all kinds in boxes, jars, tins, and
so forth. Next came about six large jugs or
demijohns of native fire-water, or <i>aguardiente</i>,
a most useful and indispensable beverage in
those latitudes, and about half a ton of salt,
a most precious article in that region. We
were going across the plains where there are
neither salt-water fountains nor salt-bearing
rock deposits, and we knew that as an article
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
of barter, salt went far beyond anything else
that we might possess, hence the large quantity
which we carried. Our arsenal consisted of
four fowling-pieces, six Remington and two
Spencer rifles, plenty of ammunition, cartridges,
gunpowder, one dozen cutlasses, or <i>machetes</i>,
and four revolvers. We also had a box with
books, our trunks with clothing, rugs, mosquito-nets,
waterproof sheets, a medicine-chest, and
two guitars of the native Colombian type; but
what rendered us most important and steady
service during the whole of that journey was
a certain wicker basket, 1 yard long, &frac34; of a
yard wide, and 10 inches in height, which
contained a complete assortment of cooking
utensils and table-ware for six persons&mdash;plates,
corkscrews, can-openers, frying-pans, and all
that one could wish to prepare as sumptuous
a meal as mortal man could desire in those vast
solitudes. The saucepans, six in number, fitted
one inside of the other, nest-wise; they were
copper-bottomed, and proved of inestimable
value. The tumblers and cups were also
nested&mdash;pewter ware with porcelain inside.
Everything was complete, compact, and so
solid that, after the long journey with its vicissitudes,
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
the wicker basket and its contents,
though looking somewhat the worse for wear,
were perfectly serviceable.</p>
<p>Leal, a man of simple habits, who had never
been in a town of more than 4,000 or 5,000
inhabitants, on looking at that display of superfluous
articles, argued that we were altogether
too rich, and that our movements would be
greatly facilitated were we to dispense with,
say, two-thirds of what lay before him on the
ground. We pleaded that since the worst had
been accomplished, namely, the transportation
across land, roads, and mountain trails, we
might as well keep what we had, and only
abandon it when forced to do so. Leal nodded
his head, as one who sees that it is useless
to argue, and nothing more was said on the
subject.</p>
<p>Everything was prepared on that New Year&rsquo;s
Day to start on the next day for the neighbouring
cattle-farm of Santa Rosa del Tua,
situated on the river Tua, one of the affluents
of the Meta, which itself is one of the most
important tributaries of the mighty Orinoco.
These arrangements and decisions once arrived
at, it was deemed prudent to celebrate our
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
arrival into the place, and the arrival on the
scene of life of the New Year, by a banquet
worthy of the double occasion.</p>
<p>A heifer was slaughtered. Leal brought upon
the scene, in front of the house where we were
stopping, the whole side of the animal trimmed
and prepared for roasting; he had passed
through it, skewer-wise, a long thin pole of
some special wood hard and difficult to burn.
A huge bonfire was lit on the ground, and
Leal fixed the lower end of the skewer quite
close to the fire, holding the side of the heifer
now right over the flame, now at a certain
distance, turning and twisting it with consummate
skill. The air was soon scented with that
odour of roast meat which so deliciously tickles
the nostrils of him who has an empty stomach.
Looking at Leal doing the roasting, I realized
Brillat-Savarin&rsquo;s dictum: <i>On devient cuisinier,
on na&icirc;t rotisseur</i>. Leal, if not a born poet, was
a born roaster. Soon the meat was ready; our
plates, forks, and knives not being sufficient
for the crowd, we preferred not to bring them
forth. Large leaves, green, fresh, and shiny,
cut from the neighbouring banana and plantain
trees, were laid on the ground both as a cover
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
and as dishes. Leal unsheathed from his belt
a long, thin shining knife as sharp as a razor,
and with wonderful dexterity cut the huge
joint, separating the ribs, so that everyone
could have a bone with a large portion of hot,
steaming, newly-broiled meat. Bread was not
forthcoming, but there was an abundance of
baked and roasted green plantains, crisp and
mealy, which did service for the best bread;
at least, so we thought. As for meat, never
in my life do I remember having enjoyed such
a delicious morsel: so the banquet consisted
of meat and roasted plantains <i>&agrave; discretion</i>. A
bottle of rum which belonged to our stock, and
which I had forgotten in the inventory given
above, went round the guests of that primitive
board, warming our hearts into conviviality and
good-humour. Finally came the big bowls of
coffee, prepared according to the local fashion,
which deserves to be described. The coffee is
roasted and ground in the usual way, but these
operations are only carried out just before the
liquor is brewed. In a large saucepan cold
water, sweetened to the taste with black sugar,
is placed over the fire, and the necessary amount
of ground coffee is thrown into it before it gets
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
warm. The heating should not be too rapid;
when the first bubbles indicate that the boiling-point
is about to be reached, the saucepan is
withdrawn from the fire, and a spoonful of cold
water dashed upon the surface of the hot
liquor almost in ebullition. This precipitates
the roasted coffee to the bottom, and gives a
most delicious beverage, which, though not as
strong as the coffee distilled according to other
methods, retains all the aroma and flavour of
the grain. The method is a very good one in
localities where delicate coffee-machines cannot
be easily procured, and it is in truth nothing
more or less than the method of preparing
Turkish coffee, with less fuss than is required
for the Oriental variety.</p>
<p>We had soon grown, in that very first day of
our encounter with him, to like Leal and to
wonder at his intimate knowledge of the plains,
the forests, and the rivers of that vast region.
He was not a Colombian; he had been born
on the shores of the river Gaurico, one of the
affluents of the Orinoco. From boyhood he
had thus come into daily contact with the
mighty rivers and the deep and mysterious
forests that cover their shores. His plan was
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
that we should first follow the river Tua down
to the Meta. On arriving at this latter river,
we should have to find larger canoes, which
would enable us to reach the Orinoco. Once
on the Orinoco we would arrive at the settlement
called Urbana, where we were sure to
obtain larger craft in which to go as far as
Caicara. Here we might wait for the steamers
that go to Ciudad Bolivar. As to the time required
for this journey, Leal said that, barring
unforeseen obstacles, fifty days might suffice
for us to reach Ciudad Bolivar. The only
inhabited places which we would come across
were first San Pedro del Arrastradero, then
Orocue, and finally San Rafael, the last
Colombian settlements where troops were
stationed, and on inquiry Leal stated that on
the river Meta it was necessary to follow the
only channel that existed, so that it would be
indispensable for us to touch at the various
towns he had named, as there was no lateral
<i>ca&ntilde;os</i> by which we might avoid them, should
we want to do so, as was the case in other
parts of the plains, where one might either
follow the main stream or some <i>ca&ntilde;o</i> or tributary.
If we wanted to take another river route,
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
we might, on reaching San Pedro del Arrastradero,
walk a short distance of about a mile
to the <i>ca&ntilde;o</i> called Caracarate, which would take
us to the river Muco, an affluent of the Vichada,
almost as large as the Meta River, and flowing
into the Orinoco. But, said Leal, if we follow
the Vichada instead of arriving on the Orinoco
below the rapids, we shall strike that river
above the rapids, and these alone will entail
more trouble and difficulty and require more
time than any other part of the river. For
the moment no decision was taken. The question
was left open to be solved as might be
most convenient at an opportune moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>Early next morning, January 2, we started
from the village, and, after a short ride across
the plain, reached the river Tua, at the house
of a small cattle-ranch called Santa Rosa
del Tua.</p>
<p>The owner of the premises welcomed us
most hospitably, and, to our joy, placed at our
disposal two small canoes. No others were to
be found there at the moment. However,
they were large enough to carry us and our
belongings, and accordingly we made ready for
an early start next day.</p>
<p>The houses&mdash;or what serve for houses in
the <i>llanos</i>&mdash;are built on the most primitive
architectural principles. Poles, varying in
thickness and in length, according to the proportions
of the desired structure, are sunk into
the ground at convenient distances, following
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
the lines either of a perfect square or of a rectangle.
Cross-beams are nailed or tied to the
vertical poles at the required height; in the
latter case the vertical poles are grooved, so as
to give additional support. From the cross-beams
on either side other beams are thrown,
slanting so as to meet in the centre, thus
forming the basis of the roof, which is again
covered with reeds, upon which are placed
several layers of palm-leaves, fastened by
means of thin ropes to the slanting beams and
poles; and thus the roof is completed. This
finishes the house for use during the dry season.</p>
<p>During the wet season the sides are covered
in the same fashion as the roof. The palm-leaf
most used is that of the <i>moriche</i>, which abounds
in the <i>llanos</i>.</p>
<p>When lying in the hammock during the dry
season one feels the breath of the breeze as it
blows across the plain, and may see the stars
twinkling in the deep blue dome of heaven, like
far-off tapers. The <i>llaneros</i>, or inhabitants of
the plains, prefer to sleep in the open air, even
without palm-leaf roofing above their heads. It
is as though they felt imprisoned indoors, and
pined for the ampler ether.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Here we had thus reached the last stage
of our land journey. The real voyage was
about to begin.</p>
<p>The reader who has followed me thus far
will have gathered that there were three of us
in this expedition&mdash;Alex, Raoul, and myself.
With us came our servant Fermin, who
adapted himself to the most urgent requirements,
being now muleteer, now valet, now
cook. Leal had engaged the services of several
<i>peones</i> to paddle the canoes when we reached
the Tua River; these numbered seventeen, so
that, including Leal and ourselves, we formed a
group of twenty-two men. The canoes were so
small that we were packed like herrings, but, as
it was impossible to obtain others, we had to
make the best of them.</p>
<p>Raoul was a sportsman: more than once
he had taken up arms against the harmless
ducks that swarm at certain seasons of the year
in the lakes studding the plateau of Bogot&aacute;. I
had no personal knowledge of his powers, but,
with the modesty and truthfulness characteristic
of all hunters and fishermen, he carefully impressed
upon us that he was a dead shot, and
that when a bird, hare, or any furred or
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
feathered creature, came within range of his gun
its doom was certain.</p>
<p>Immediately upon our arrival at the river
Tua, the shores of which are covered with a
dense forest, he called our attention to the
numberless birds to be seen, and as soon as he
could manage it he left us, accompanied by one
of the men, and was speedily lost to sight
amongst the trees. Shortly afterwards the
report of his gun reached us with such frequency
that one might think he was wasting
powder for mere love of smoke. By-and-by
he returned, bringing with him about sixteen
different birds of various sizes and kinds,
sufficient to feed the whole expedition for one
or two days. He was on the point of starting
on another murderous excursion, when we
remonstrated against the wanton destruction
of animal life. Leal quietly observed that if
Raoul thus continued wasting powder and shot
he would soon exhaust our store of those indispensable
articles, the lack of which might entail
most serious consequences later on. On hearing
this we held what might be called a council of
war, at which it was decided that no more birds
or game were to be shot than were absolutely
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
indispensable. We were influenced not so
much by a feeling of humanity or love for the
birds as by the fact that a long journey lay
before us, that the loss of a canoe, the flooding
of a river, or illness, or any accident that might
befall us, would detain us for much longer than
we had bargained. Raoul reluctantly listened
to all these reasons, but, acknowledging their
force, agreed to comply with them.</p>
<p>Our descent of the river Tua began next day.
The waters were very shallow, owing to the
dry season, and, as our men could not use their
paddles, they punted the canoes down-stream.
We were often detained by palisades which
obstructed the current. These were formed
by trunks uprooted from the shores by the river
in its flood, and then jettisoned in the bed of
the stream. In the dry season they stood forth
like small islands, and gathered round them all
the floating d&eacute;bris of the river. These palisades,
with which we met very often, gave us a
deal of trouble. We often had to jump out of
the canoes and either drag or push them, as
they would stick to the sandy bottom, and
punting failed to make them budge. We took
to this task cheerfully, and found it tolerable
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
sport, until one of our men was stung by a
peculiar sort of fish, black and round, called
<i>raya</i>. This lies hidden in the sand, and, when
touched or trodden upon, stings, darting its
harpoon into the ankle or the calf, leaving
its point in the wound, a most painful one,
which continues to smart for several days.
The man, who was stung in our presence,
cried and moaned like a child, so intense was
the pain. After this we were decidedly chary
of lending a hand in dragging or pushing the
canoes, and&mdash;I must confess it to our shame&mdash;we
would wade booted to the shore and wait
till they had been got afloat again, rather than
take the chances of being stung in our turn.</p>
<p>We had started at about six in the morning;
towards five in the afternoon Leal began to
cast his eyes about in search of a nice, dry,
sandy beach upon which to pitch our camp for
the night. So far we had always found some
house or hut to sleep in; now, for the first
time, we were faced by the necessity of camping
in the open air without any roof whatever
above our heads. We experienced a peculiar
sensation of unwarranted fear&mdash;a dread arising,
doubtless, from the force of habit in the civilized
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
man, naturally averse to imitating the birds and
the beasts, which sleep under God&rsquo;s heaven
and run all risks; but whatever our feelings,
we were forced to accept the inevitable.</p>
<p>As soon as a satisfactory strip of beach was
found, we jumped ashore. The canoes were
dragged halfway out of the water, and tied
with stout ropes to neighbouring trees to prevent
their being carried away in case of an
unexpected flood&mdash;by no means an impossible
contingency. The men took out the mats
upon which we were to sleep, and as there
were swarms of the mosquitoes, sand-flies, and
numerous insects which make life a burden in
the early hours of the night on the shores of
these rivers, the mosquito-bars, made of cotton
cloth, were rigged up over the mats.</p>
<p>Fermin, who had been promoted to the rank
of private cook for Alex, Raoul, and myself,
prepared our supper, making use of the saucepans
and sundry implements contained in our
travelling basket. To prepare their meals, the
men used a huge iron pot, which was soon
tilted over a large fire.</p>
<p>We were four days on the river Tua punting
or paddling, according to the depth of water.
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
When we reached the river Meta, we had
already arranged the daily routine best suited
to our requirements, and I might as well, once
for all, describe it.</p>
<p>Our acting chief, Leal, ever watchful and
alert, wakened us at about three in the morning.
Every man had his appointed task: two of
them prepared the indispensable coffee in the
fashion of the land; others folded up the mats,
the mosquito-bars, and whatever else might
have been landed. Alex, Raoul, and I would
in the meantime stand on the river brink,
whilst two of the men poured upon us small
cataracts of water drawn from the river in the
<i>coyabras</i> or <i>totumas</i> cut from native gourds,
which form an indispensable part of the
domestic arrangements in the <i>llanos</i>. It would
have been sheer madness to bathe in the river,
with its <i>rayas</i>, or water-snakes, or perhaps
some shy, dissembling alligator in quest of a
tasty morsel.</p>
<p>Sandy beaches are the best places for camping
on the shores of tropical rivers. They are
dry, clean, soft, and perfectly free from snakes,
scorpions, tarantulas, and all such obnoxious
creatures, which are more likely to be found
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
amongst the high luxuriant grass and the leafy
trees.</p>
<p>Between four and five, as soon as it was
ready, every man drank a large goblet of
coffee and a small glass of aniseed <i>aguardiente</i>,
which is said to be a specific against malaria.
The men&rsquo;s faith in the virtue of the distilled
spirit was astounding; they never failed to
take it, and would even ask for more, lest the
quantity given were not enough to protect
them from the dreaded illness. Though the
merits of quinine are more universally acknowledged,
it did not seem to be as acceptable, nor
to be coveted with equal greediness.</p>
<p>We generally started at about five in the
morning, paddling steadily till about eleven,
when we landed as soon as we found a suitable
spot, if possible shaded with trees. Here we
would hang the hammocks, prepare the midday
repast, and wait until three, letting the
hottest hours of the day pass by. At this
time the sun seemed to dart real rays of fire
upon the burnished waters, whose reflection
dazzled and blinded our eyes.</p>
<p>About three in the afternoon we would start
again for two or three hours more, until a convenient
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
beach was found; once there, the camp
was formed without delay, the canoes tied
up, the mats spread, and in a few minutes
two huge bonfires, made of driftwood, sent
their glad flames flickering in the night air.
After supper we crept under the mosquito-bars,
and waited for Leal to call us in the
morning.</p>
<p>The seasons in the plains, as is well known,
are sharply divided into dry and rainy. The
first lasts from May to November, and the
second from November to May. During the
wet season it rains from eighteen to twenty
hours out of the twenty-four; showers are not
frequent during the dry season, but they fall
now and then.</p>
<p>The third or fourth night that we spent on
the banks of the Tua, I was awakened by
feeling a moist sheet over my face, and at once
realized that the heavy rain had beaten down
the mosquito-bar. There was nothing for it
but to cover myself with the waterproof
<i>poncho</i>, sitting up for greater convenience, and
disengaging myself from the fallen mosquito-net.
There we all sat helpless under the
dense cataract. The beach, slanting towards
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
the river, bore with it the waters from the
higher ground, and as my body made an indenture
in the sand, I felt on either side a
rushing stream. Fortunately, the shower was
soon over, the bonfires were heaped with
driftwood and blazed forth joyously. Coffee
was specially prepared for the occasion, and we
sat in the genial warmth of the flames until the
sun burst forth on the horizon. That morning
we did not start as early as usual: the tents
and covers were spread in the sun, and after an
hour or so were again dry and soft. Then
we started on our journey, leaving behind
us the discomforts of the night. The rain
seemed to have gladdened the forest, and
brightened the trees and bushes into a livelier
green. During the journey we underwent a
similar experience upon two or three other
occasions.</p>
<p>As for food, we had a comfortable supply,
and hardly a day passed without our having
either some fine bird, or at times a larger piece
of game in the shape of a species of wild-boar,
fairly plentiful in that locality, the flesh of which
is quite agreeable after one learns to eat it.
Besides game, we also had plenty of fish. All
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
this without counting the salt meat and tinned
provisions. The birds most abundant were
ducks of various descriptions, wild turkeys, and
a beautiful bird of fine dark-bluish plumage,
similar to a wild turkey, called <i>paujil</i> by the
natives, the meat of which greatly resembles
that of the pheasant.</p>
<p>At about this stage of the journey an incident
took place which shows how even the humblest
tasks in life require a certain degree of ability
and experience. One day on the river Tua,
Raoul&mdash;who, as I have said, was a great
hunter before the Lord, and had no more
esteem than most men for the milder arts&mdash;had
brought down a beautiful duck of exceptional
size, and of the kind known as &lsquo;royal duck.&rsquo;
Not satisfied with his triumph as a Nimrod, he
took it into his head to cook the bird himself
and rival the achievements of Vattel or Car&ecirc;me.
He invited me to help him in his undertaking.
My culinary attainments being purely of a
theoretical kind, I promised him my moral
support and hearty co-operation in the shape
of advice. We invited Alex to share our
wonderful supper, to which he replied that,
being aware of the perils most incident to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
efforts of inexperienced cooks, however enthusiastic
they might be, he preferred the men&rsquo;s
supper, which, though humbler, was far more
to be depended on. Heedless of this taunt,
Raoul went on with his work. A pot filled
with water was placed over the fire, and as
soon as it was boiling the bird was plunged
into it. In due course Raoul began to pluck
valiantly; feathers black and bluish fell from
his hand numerous as flakes of snow in a winter
storm. When he began to tire after a while,
I took the bird in hand, and continued the
task, the feathers falling like dry leaves in the
autumnal forest. After half an hour of steady
work, when the ground was literally covered
with black feathers, that blessed bird seemed
untouched. We were beginning to feel anxious
and hungry, and the tempting whiffs from the
large iron pot, where the men were stirring
their stew, stung our nostrils in a tantalizing
fashion. However, it was now a question of
pride and self-esteem, and we were bound to
cook the bird at any cost. By-and-by Alex,
holding a steaming plate in his hand, came
to us and invited us to eat. Raoul rejected
the offer, and though I was most anxious to
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
accept it, I felt bound in loyalty to stand
by him. We told Alex that we wanted to
reserve the fulness of our appetite for our
delicious bird, to which Alex replied that by
the time that bird was ready we should certainly
be hungry enough to devour it, leaving the
bones quite clean. Raoul and I took turns at
plucking the duck, which at last seemed to
yield, showing a few whitish specks here and
there devoid of all feathery covering. Seeing
our plight, Fermin, who had stood by, not
being called upon to help, seized the bird,
declaring that we had allowed it to become
chilled, and that the perfect plucking of it
was well-nigh impossible. However, he undertook
the job most courageously, and finally,
taking advantage of the shades of night, which
facilitated a compromise, we dropped that
royal duck into the boiling water and pretended
to enjoy our supper, such as it was,
when ready. How much we ate is a question
as to which I need not go into detail here, but
I must own that in lying down upon my mat
under the mosquito-bar I felt famished. From
that day onwards both Raoul and I decided
to forego all interference in matters culinary,
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
beyond occasional advice. I have no doubt that,
had Fermin or one of the men undertaken the
task, we should not only have had our supper
much sooner, but a dish fit for any man&rsquo;s
palate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>On the fourth day, about two hours&rsquo; sail from
the confluence of the Tua with the Meta River,
we stopped at a large cattle-ranch called Santa
Barbara. The owner invited us to a dinner&mdash;the
inevitable dishes of the <i>llano</i>: meat roasted
over a bonfire, plaintains and coffee.</p>
<p>The ranch consisted, we were told, of about
10,000 head of cattle, and was typical of the
ranches to be found on the <i>llanos</i> of Colombia
and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Here, in the person of what might be called
the sub-manager, whose name was Secundino,
we came face to face with a real tiger-hunter.</p>
<p>After dinner I asked Secundino how men
fleeted the time away in that lonely region
beyond the din of civilized life. His statements
corroborated what I had heard before,
that there is no ownership of land in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
<i>llanos</i>; the herds graze freely over the plains,
the animals being practically wild, and kept
together by the presence amongst them of a
few tame cattle which, being accustomed to
the presence of man, will remain in the neighbourhood
of the houses or <i>caneyes</i>. Another
great attraction to the cattle is the salt which
is strewn upon large slabs of stone or flat
boards. By these two devices, thousands of
animals are kept within a comparatively short
distance of the ranch.</p>
<p>To enable each ranch-owner to brand the
cattle belonging to him, <i>rodeos</i> or round-ups
are held two or three times during the year.
These <i>rodeos</i> are gatherings of the herds. The
men ride out in all directions from the ranch,
and drive the cattle towards the <i>corrales</i>. In
this task they are greatly helped by the presence
of the tame animals, which are easily led or
driven as required, and are always followed by
the others.</p>
<p>Once in the <i>corrales</i>, the branding begins.
A red-hot iron is used, shaped either to form
one or two letters or some special sign which
constitutes the trade or hall mark, so to speak,
of the respective ranch. The animals are
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
forced to pass through a long, narrow enclosure
between two fences, and are branded as they
go by; but with animals that give a great deal
of trouble a different method is followed. This
consists in starting the bull, heifer, or cow, as
the case may be, on the run. A man on horseback
follows, and when both the horse and the
bull have attained sufficient impetus, the man
seizes the bull by the tail, and with a sudden
twist turns it over on its side, jumping at once
from his horse to pass the tail under the bull&rsquo;s
leg; this compresses certain muscles, prevents
all motion, and leaves the fallen animal helpless.
The branding is then done without any
difficulty, either on the fore or the hind quarters.</p>
<p>Secundino told us that this way of throwing
the cattle down was not confined to the branding
season, but that it formed a frequent sport
amongst herdsmen in the plains, as it required
great skill to accomplish it. Another sport in
which he and his friends indulged, and which
he described with great zest, was riding wild
bulls. The process consists first in throwing
the bull to the ground, whereupon a thick rope
is tied as a girdle, only that it is placed quite
close to the withers and right under the forelegs
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
of the animal. All this time the bull has
been held on the ground, bellowing and panting
for sheer rage; as soon as the rope is ready,
the intending rider stands by the side of the
animal with his two hands stuck between the
rope and the skin, on either side of the spine,
and the moment the bull is let loose and stands
on its feet the man leaps on its back. Then
follows a wonderful struggle: the beast, unaccustomed
to any burden, rears and plunges,
springs backwards and forwards with great
violence; the man, always spurred, increases
the fury of the animal by pricking its sides.
His two arms, like bars of iron, stand rigid,
and man and bullock seem as though made
of one piece. At last the bull is exhausted, and
sullenly acknowledges the superior force of the
rider; but it takes rare courage and strength
to accomplish this feat.</p>
<p>After describing these and other pastimes,
Secundino quietly added:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whenever my work leaves me time, I kill
tigers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said this unpretentiously, yet with a
certain air of self-consciousness that must have
brought the shadow of a doubting smile to my
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
lips. Secundino saw this, and, without appearing
to take notice of it, invited us outside the house,
and showed us, at a certain distance from it,
lying on the ground, ten tigers&rsquo; skulls, some
of which bore traces of having been recently
cleansed from skin and flesh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;that I have some proofs
of my tiger-killing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He told us that the tigers were the worst
enemies of the cattle-farmer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Other animals,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;will take just
what they want, but the tiger is fierce, cruel,
and kills for the sake of killing. If he should
happen to get into an enclosure containing
twenty or thirty young calves, he will kill them
all, and take one away with him. We are at
open and constant warfare with the tigers,&rsquo; he
added, &lsquo;and there is no truce between us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <i>llaneros</i> usually kill tigers by spearing
them. Referring to this, Secundino said that
doubtless it was more dangerous than shooting
the beast down at long range with a Winchester
or a Remington rifle; &lsquo;but,&rsquo; he went on to say,
&lsquo;powder and lead are expensive, cartridges are
difficult to obtain, and when once exhausted
your weapon is no better than a broomstick.
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
The spear, however, is always ready, and never
fails you. When I go out tiger-hunting I take
my dogs, who follow the scent and guide me.
I carry with me, besides the spears, a muzzle-loader,
in case of emergency. The moment
the dogs see the tiger they give cry; the beast
seeks higher ground, and the fight with the
dogs begins at once. The tiger is afraid even
of a cur. The dogs that we have here are
well trained, and though at times they are
killed by the tiger, that seldom happens. I
follow my dogs, keeping the animal well in
sight, with my spear ready, and at the right
moment dash forward and plunge it into his
breast. If the blow is a good one, that ends
it. Now and then it is necessary to fire the
rifle into him; but this is a great pity, owing
to the waste of lead and gunpowder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I am trying to repeat here word by word
Secundino&rsquo;s quiet statement. It sounds fanciful
and exaggerated, but all those who have
travelled over the plains of either Venezuela or
Colombia will have heard that such is the
commonest mode of tiger-killing amongst the
<i>llaneros</i>. The tiger of these latitudes, however,
is not the same as the tiger of India and other
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
parts of Asia. It is smaller, but not less
ferocious; it is spotted, and not striped. The
spear used is very long, made of very hard
wood, and has a most murderous appearance.</p>
<p>Secundino, after telling me of his short way
with tigers, asked me to handle the weapon,
and generously gave me some instructions as to
the exact poise to be adopted for striking a
blow, explaining to me how dangerous it might
be were I to forget the rules which he could
recommend from experience. To begin with, I
could hardly lift the spear, and, then, there was
practically no chance of my ever going to seek
a tiger in his lair. Secundino, however, was
profoundly in earnest, and, rather than disabuse
him or hurt his feelings, I solemnly promised
him that I would never kill tigers otherwise
than in strict conformity with his advice, and
that at the first opportunity I would practise
throwing the spear and poising my body, so as
to make sure.</p>
<p>Towards evening, as we were about leaving,
when I was already seated in the canoe, whilst
Leal was still ashore, I overheard these words
passing between him and Secundino:</p>
<p>&lsquo;How far are you going, Friend Leal?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&lsquo;Down to the Orinoco, to accompany these
gentlemen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How are you coming back, by land or by
water?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know yet&mdash;that depends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, all right; if you come this way, I
should like you to tackle a horse that we have
here, which no one seems able to ride, and
which I dare not tackle myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never you mind,&rsquo; answered Leal; &lsquo;I will see
to it when I return.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here was a revelation. Leal&rsquo;s prowess grew
in our estimation. This guide of ours was called
upon to break in a horse which Secundino, the
tiger-hunter, whose title to the name, if devoid
of diplomas or academic signatures, was vouched
for by the ten tiger-skulls which we had seen,
would not dare to ride himself!</p>
<p>On we went towards the Meta River, leaving
our friends on the shore shouting to us messages
of good speed. We soon noticed that our canoe,
being lighter in draft, had left the other far
behind it.</p>
<p>It darkened much earlier than we expected,
and to our great regret we saw that the second
canoe could not catch us up, which was annoying,
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
as supper, beds, and everything else, with the
exception of a demijohn of aniseed <i>aguardiente</i>,
were in it. We landed at the first beach that
we struck, hoping against hope that the
stragglers might overtake us.</p>
<p>Time had passed so agreeably at Santa
Barbara, listening to Secundino&rsquo;s tales, that
we had not noticed how late it was. It seemed
to us, furthermore, that darkness had set in
earlier than usual. On hearing some remark
to that effect, Fermin observed that the sun had
set for us that day earlier than usual. He laid
stress upon the words &lsquo;for us,&rsquo; and, on being
asked what he meant thereby, said that the
darkness had been caused by a cloud which
had interposed itself between us and the setting
sun, thus bringing night earlier than usual.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What nonsense are you talking about?&rsquo; said
Raoul. &lsquo;There is no cloud in the matter; we
went on talking and talking, and forgot the time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; Fermin said, without moving a
muscle; &lsquo;I know what I am talking about.
The cloud was formed by the feathers of that
bird which we tried to pluck yesterday; they
are so many that they darken the light of
the sun!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Up to this day I cannot say what happened.
I do not know if we mistook the hour of the
day and were overtaken by night, or if, in
truth, as Fermin asserted, the wrathful ghost
of the mishandled duck spread its black feathers
above our heads, thus forming a mantle like the
mantle of arrows which the Spartan warriors
asked the Persian invaders to fire at them, so
that they might fight in the shade. This problem,
which contains historical, astronomical
and atmospherical elements, will remain for
ever as dark and mysterious as the feathers of
the dead bird.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>Night soon asserted her sway. The blue vault
of heaven, alive with innumerable stars, was clear
and diaphanous; no cloud was to be seen. The
evening noises died away, and the dead silence
was only broken now and then by a vague
rumour wafted mysteriously through space&mdash;the
wash of waters on the shore, or possibly
the lisp of forests by the river. We gave up
all hope of the other canoe arriving that night,
and faced the inevitable&mdash;no supper, no beds.
As in our own canoe we carried a demijohn
of <i>aguardiente</i>, one or two generous draughts
were our only supper. We were not hampered
by excess of riches or of comforts; as to the
selection of our beds, the whole extent of the
beach was equally sandy and soft; but, having
slept for many nights on the shores of the Tua,
and knowing that we were at its confluence
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
with the Meta, for the sake of a change&mdash;a
distinction without a difference&mdash;we stretched
ourselves full length on the side of the beach
looking to the Meta River.</p>
<p>The water-course, practically unknown to
civilization, appeared to me as I lay there like
a wandering giant lost amidst the forests and
the plains of an unknown continent. The
surface of the waters sparkled in the starlight
like hammered steel. My thoughts followed
the luminous ripples until they were lost to
sight in the darkness of the opposite shore,
or, wandering onwards with the flow, melted
into the horizon. Whither went those waters?
Whence came they? What were their evolutions,
changes, and transformations? Idle questions!
Flow of life or flow of wave, who but
He that creates all things can know its source
and its finality? Idle cavillings indeed!</p>
<p>Suddenly, as drowsiness had begun to seize
me, a wonderful phenomenon took place. There
from the midst of the waters arose an indistinct
yet mighty figure; high it stood amidst the
waters which parted, forming a sort of royal
mantle upon its shoulders; it gazed upon me
with the sublime placidity of the still seas,
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
the high mountains, the unending plains, the
primeval forests, and all the manifestations of
Nature, great and serene in their power and
majesty. And the figure spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Listen to me, O pilgrim, lost in these vast
solitudes; listen to the voice of the wandering
streams! We rivers bring life to forest and
valley; we are children of the mountains, heralds
of continents, benefactors of man. My current,
powerful and mighty though it seems, is but
a tiny thread of the many streams that, mingled
and interwoven, so to say, go to form the main
artery of whirling, heaving water called the
Orinoco. From north and south, from east
and west, we all flow along the bosom of the
plains, after having gathered unto ourselves the
playful streamlets, the murmuring brooks that
swell into torrents and dash down the mountain-sides,
filling the hills and the intervening valleys
with life and joy. They come from the highest
slopes&mdash;nay, from the topmost peaks crowned
with everlasting snow, the sources of our life;
down they rush, and after innumerable turns
and twists, after forming now cataracts, now
placid lakes, reach the plain, and in their course
they broaden the large streams which in turn
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
merge with others in the huge basin, and form
the vast artery that drains the surface of a great
part of the continent, and bears its tribute to
the Atlantic Ocean. Yea, verily indeed, we
rivers are as twin brothers of Time; the hours
pass and pass, ceaseless as our waves; they
flow into Eternity, we into the bosom of the
great deep. This land, the land of your birth
and of mine, to-day an unknown quantity in
the history of the world, is a destined site of
a mighty empire. The whole continent of South
America is the reserve store for the future
generations of millions of men yet unborn.
Hither they will come from all parts of the
world: on the surface of the globe no more
favourable spot exists for the home of mankind.
Along the coast of the Pacific Ocean runs the
mighty backbone of the Cordillera like a bulwark,
high, immense, stately; above it, like the towers
and turrets in the walls of a fortified city, rise
the hundred snow-capped peaks that look east
and west, now on the ocean, now on the ever-spreading
undulating plains, and south and north
to the line of mountains extending for thousands
of miles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the very heart of the tropical zone, where
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
the equatorial sun darts his burning rays, are
the plateaus of the Andes, hundreds of square
miles in extent, with all the climates and the
multitudinous products of the temperate zone.
In the heart and bowels of the mountains are
the precious metals coveted by man&rsquo;s avarice
and vanity, those forming the supreme goal
of his endeavours; and the useful&mdash;indeed, the
truly precious&mdash;metals, coal, iron, copper, lead,
and all others that are known to man, exist in
a profusion well-nigh illimitable. The trade-winds,
whose wings have swept across the whole
width of the Atlantic Ocean, laden with moisture,
do not stop their flight when the sea of moving
waters ceases and the sea of waving grass begins.
Across the plains, over the tree-tops of the
primeval forests, shaking the plumage of the
palm-trees, ascending the slopes of the hills,
higher, still higher, into the mountains, and
finally up to the loftiest peaks, those winds
speed their course, and there the last drops of
moisture are wrung from them by that immeasurable
barrier raised by the hand of God;
their force seems to be spent, and, like birds
that have reached their native forest, they fold
their wings and are still. The moisture thus
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
gathered and thus deposited forms the thousand
currents of water that descend from the heights
at the easternmost end of the continent, and
convert themselves into the largest and most
imposing water systems in the world. Thus
is formed the Orinoco system, which irrigates
the vast plains of Colombia and Venezuela.
Further south, created by a similar concurrence
of circumstances and conditions, the Amazon
system drags the volume of its wandering sea
across long, interminable leagues of Brazilian
forest and plain. Its many streams start in
their pilgrimage from the interior of Colombia,
of Ecuador, of Peru, and of Bolivia, and these
two systems of water-ways, which intersect such
an immense extent of land thousands of miles
from the mouth of the main artery that plunges
into the sea, are connected by a natural canal,
the Casiquiare River, so that the traveller might
enter either river, follow its course deep into
the heart of the continent, cross by water to
the other, and then reappear on the ocean,
always in the same boat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If the wealth of the mountains is boundless
and virgin, if on the slopes and on the plateaus
and the neighbouring valleys all the agricultural
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
products useful to man may be grown&mdash;and
the forests teem with wealth that belongs
to him who first takes it&mdash;if the rocks likewise
cover or bear immense deposits of all the
metals and minerals useful to man, the lowlands
and the plains offer grazing-ground for
untold herds of cattle and horses, and further
to the south beyond the Amazon, running
southward, not eastward like the Orinoco and
the Amazon, the Parana unrolls its waves,
which, after leaving the tropic, enter the
southern temperate zone, irrigating for untold
miles the endless pampas of Argentina and
Uruguay. In very truth, this continent is the
Promised Land.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In your pilgrimage along the waters of the
Orinoco, you will see all the wonders of tropical
Nature. Now the forests will stand on either
bank close along the shores in serried file, and
moving mirrors of the waters will reflect the
murmuring tops of the trees, noisy and full of
life as the winds sweep by in their flight, or
else the frowning rock, bare and rugged, will
stand forth from the current like the wall of a
medieval castle. Now the trees will open a
gap through which, as from under a triumphal
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
arch, the current of a river, a wanderer from
the mysterious and unknown depths of the
neighbouring forests, pours forth into the main
stream and mingles with the passing waters,
joining his fate to theirs, even as the High
Priest of some unknown creed might issue
from the temple and mingle with the passing
crowd. Some rivers that reach the main artery
have had but a short pilgrimage, the junction
of their many waters having taken place at no
great distance from the main stream; others
have had a long wandering, sometimes placid
and serene, sometimes amidst rocks and
boulders, with an ever frenzied and agitated
course like the lives of men striving and
struggling till the last great trumpet sounds.
The course of the river will be studded with
islands large enough for the foundation of
empires, and before reaching the sea the river
will extend and spread its current into a
thousand streams, as if loth to part from the
Mother Earth it sought to embrace more firmly
in its grasp, and our waters will flow into the
unplumbed deep, there to mingle with those of
all the rivers, whether their course has been
through lands alive with civilization, swarming
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
with multitudes of men on their shores, laden
with the memories of centuries and famous in
history, or whether they, like us, have wandered
through vast solitudes where Nature is still
supreme in her primeval pride, as yet unpolluted
by the hand of man. There we all
meet, and to us what men call time and its
divisions exist not, for all the transformations
that affect mankind are as naught to us who
form part and parcel of Nature itself, who only
feel time after the lapse of &aelig;ons which to the
mind of man are practically incomprehensible.
Seek to learn the lesson of humility, to acknowledge
the power of the Creator, who gave to
man what we rivers and all other material
things can never hope for&mdash;a future beyond
this earth, higher, brighter, infinite, eternal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The figure seemed to sink slowly under the
mantle of waters that had covered its shoulders;
the sun was rising in the eastern horizon, the
rumour of awakening Nature filled the air
with its thousand echoes, and drifting rapidly
towards us we saw Leal with the canoe that
had remained behind the night before.</p>
<p>On telling Alex, Raoul, and Fermin my
experience, and asking in good faith what they
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
had thought of the visitation, they looked
askance at me. It seems that sleep had overpowered
them; they had not seen the river-god
of the Meta, and irreverently set down the
whole occurrence to the quality of my supper
the preceding night. It is ever thus with
unbelievers; they will seek some material or
vulgar explanation for that which they cannot
understand and have not seen.</p>
<p>That very morning, after the necessary
arrangements and the usual morning coffee,
we started down the Meta River. If we might
have called the navigation on the Tua somewhat
amphibious, navigation on the Meta,
specially for such small craft as we possessed,
seemed to us as on the open sea. Our first
care was to seek larger canoes. Leal guided
us through one of the neighbouring <i>ca&ntilde;os</i> to
a cattle-ranch, where he expected to suit our
requirements. This <i>ca&ntilde;o</i> chanced to be famous
for its snakes, principally of the kind called
<i>macaurel</i>, a dark brownish species, varying
from 2 to 4 and 5 feet in length, and from
&frac14; inch to 2 inches in diameter. When in repose
they coil themselves around the branches
of the trees, and their bite, if not cured immediately,
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
is fatal. Leal shot one of the
horrible reptiles in the body; the linking of
the rings that take the place of vertebr&aelig; being
thus unloosened, the coils became wider, the
animal lost its grip and fell into the water,
staining it with a blue-greenish reflection of a
metallic hue. It seems that one shot of the
smallest size is sufficient to kill these snakes,
provided it breaks one of the rings above
mentioned. I shuddered as we passed under
the trees, knowing that many of these dreaded
reptiles must be above our heads. The <i>ca&ntilde;o</i>
in some parts was so narrow and the forest so
dense that it was impossible to avoid the overhanging
branches, and when I thought that we
should have to go over the same route next
day, disgust and a feeling of dread took possession
of me. By the time we reached our
destination, after a journey of eight or ten
miles, over twenty of these creatures had been
brought down. We obtained two large canoes,
which seemed to us like veritable ships or
floating palaces compared to the little craft we
had used for so many days. We turned to the
river Meta, and did not feel safe until we had
left the <i>ca&ntilde;o</i> behind, and could breathe once
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
more in the open air on the bosom of the large
river, with only heaven above our heads.</p>
<p>The Meta River, which flows entirely upon
Colombian territory, describes large winding
curves in its course eastward towards the
Orinoco. Its banks are high and well defined,
its channel fairly steadfast even in the dry
season. This is not common, most of these
rivers often shifting their course, to the despair
of pilots and navigators. Both sides of the
Meta we knew were occupied, or, rather, frequently
visited, by various wild tribes. Now
and then Leal would point out a part of the
shore, stating that it belonged to some ranch,
but how he could know was a mystery to us,
as no visible difference existed.</p>
<p>The temperature, though quite hot in the
middle of the day, was agreeable, and even
cool, in the early morning and a greater part
of the night. The trade-wind, which blows
steadily every day during the dry season, at
times gathered such force that we were compelled,
going against it as we did, to wait long
hours for it to subside. Our canoes were not
so arranged as to enable us to hoist sail and
tack against the wind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>On the river Meta we observed a large
species of fish, which, had we been at sea, we
should have identified at once as porpoises.
The men told us that they were called <i>bufeos</i>,
and in reality came from the sea, having
ascended the waters of the Orinoco for
thousands of miles, and branched off into the
Meta River. One of the men, illiterate like all
his fellows, but versed in forest, mountain and
plain lore, stated that those <i>bufeos</i> were the
friends of man; that they loved music and song;
that they would follow a boat or canoe whence
the echoes of singing or of some musical instrument
could be heard for miles and miles at a time;
that when they were present in the water the
alligators and all the other enemies of man
kept away, or were driven away by the <i>bufeos</i>;
and that whenever by chance the fishermen
caught one of these, he would at once release
it in remembrance of their friendship for mankind.
These were, therefore, our old-time
friends the porpoises.</p>
<p>The simple tale of the man, one of our
paddlers, who had never been in a city in
his life nor seen any of the wonders of our
times, to whose mind such words as civilization,
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
Fatherland, and religion, as well as many others
that form the glib vocabulary of modern man,
were mere empty sounds or air, could not but
set me a-thinking&mdash;first, as to the value of those
words. Fatherland, our country, his and mine,
yet how different the conception, and how
those consecrated, holy words are abused by
the tricksters, great and small, who control
and exploit mankind for their own benefit!
Patriotism should consist in justice and equality
of rights and tolerance to all, whereas, in fact,
it is but a mask for the greed and avarice
of the strong. My countryman is he whose
ideals are identical with mine. What makes
another being my fellow-man and my brother
is an identity of ideals, not a concurrence of
geographical conditions of birth. If he who
is born ten thousand miles away in an unknown
climate and in a different latitude shares with
me the love of justice and of freedom, and will
struggle for them even as I would, why should
we be separated by conventional distinctions
which benefit neither him nor me nor justice
nor freedom as ideals?</p>
<p>I thought, are these lands and this vast
continent still virgin in the sense that humanity
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
has not exploited them? are they to be the last
scene of the stale criminal imposture now called
civilization? Are men to come by thousands
and by millions to these plains and these mountains,
and settle on the shores of these rivers,
bringing with them their old prejudices, their
old tyrannical conventionalities, the hatreds that
have stained history with blood for hundreds
and for thousands of years, rearing on these
new lands the old iniquities, calling them
fatherlands, baptizing their crimes with holy
words, and murdering in the name of
patriotism? If such is to be the future of
these lands, far better were it that the mighty
rivers should overflow their course and convert
into one immense lake, twin brother of the
neighbouring sea, the vast plains, the endless
mysterious forest; and that the immense
bulwark of the Andes, aflame with a thousand
volcanoes, should make the region inhospitable
and uninhabitable to man: for of
iniquity there is enough, and no more should
be created under God&rsquo;s heaven.</p>
<p>But the tale set me also a-thinking of the
power of tradition and the beauty of song. If
my memory plays me no trick, Arion, homeward-bound
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
from the Court of Corinth, and
laden with gifts of a King who worshipped
song, was seized and thrown into the sea by
the crew, but the listening dolphins or porpoises,
grateful for the heavenly message thus
delivered by him, bore him ashore and saved
his life. So, more or less, runs the classical
tale; and here in the wilds of America, from
the lips of an unlettered woodman, the same
beautiful conceit, clothed in simple words, had
rung in my ears. The power of song, the
beauty of the legend, had filtered itself through
hundreds of generations from the days of our
mother Greece, the mother of art and of beauty,
across the mountains and the years and the seas
and the continents, and the legend and the
allegory were alive in their pristine and essential
characteristics in the forests of tropical
America. This gave me hope. If the power
of things ideal, of things that have in them the
divine charm of undying force, overcomes time
and distance, why should not the ideal of
righteousness, of liberty, and of justice prevail?
And the vast continent of South America, why
should it not be the predestined home of a
happy and regenerate humanity? The trade-winds
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
which come from the old world and
across the ocean are purified on the heights
of the Cordilleras. Even so humanity in that
pilgrimage that is bound to take place ere
long, as the ancient world begins to overflow,
may regenerate itself and establish liberty and
justice in that new world. If these be dreams,
awakening were bitter.</p>
<p>We soon heard that it was easy to reach one
of the affluents of the Vichada by crossing the
plains for about a mile overland, and, all things
considered, decided to abandon the Meta River,
even though the journey might be longer than
we had at first intended. Thus, on the fourth
day of navigation down the Meta we stopped,
and at a place known as San Pedro del Arrastradero,
where we found quite a large settlement,
about 150 people, we left the Meta
behind us and at once made ready for our
journey through the Vichada, as large as the
Meta, we were told, and inhabited by numerous
savage tribes. This gave additional interest to
the journey, and we looked forward to it with
pleasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>The settlement of San Pedro del Arrastradero&mdash;or
of Arimena, as it is also called&mdash;lies on the
right shore of the River Meta about 150
miles from its confluence with the Orinoco.
Within a very short distance of the Meta at
that point, less than a mile to the south, the
<i>ca&ntilde;o</i> of Caracarate branches towards the Muco
River, which, flowing to the south-east, joins the
Vichada; the latter, of about the same volume
as the Meta, flows south-east till it strikes the
Orinoco above the rapids. The Meta and the
Vichada and the Orinoco form a triangle, of
which the last named is the base. The Vichada
enters the main stream some fifty miles above,
and the Meta about 200 miles below, the
series of rapids which divide the river into
the Lower and the Upper Orinoco.</p>
<p>Scattered far and wide at long distances
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
apart on the plain which borders the Meta are
numerous cattle-ranches, and on its very shores
are settlements testifying to the effort of civilized
man. But the new region that we were
about to enter, irrigated by the Muco, the
Vichada, and their affluents, is absolutely wild,
and has seldom been crossed by white men
other than stray missionaries, or adventurous
traders in search of cheap rubber, resinous
substances, tonga beans, hammocks, etc. These
the Indians exchange for trifles, or implements
which they prize very highly: to the wild
inhabitants an axe, a cutlass, a knife, are
veritable treasures, distinguishing their owner
among his fellows.</p>
<p>The tribes along the shores of the Meta River
were known to be mostly hostile and aggressive.
Travellers on that river always, if possible,
pitch their camps on islets in mid-stream for
fear of night attacks, and even then they need
to keep strict watch and have their arms beside
them. It is dangerous for small expeditions to
cross the part of the river below San Pedro del
Arrastradero.</p>
<p>But the tribes along the region that we were
about to cross, though no less primitive than
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
the others, are mild and easily amenable to
civilization. They are numerous, and under
good guidance might be advantageously employed
in useful work, might be taught to
gather the natural products abounding in the
forests, and cultivate the soil systematically.
Their present notions of agriculture are
elementary; they only practise it on a very
small scale, relying principally on what they
can hunt and fish.</p>
<p>At San Pedro we found an individual who
for over thirty years had been in the habit of
travelling on the Muco and the Vichada, often
going as far as Ciudad Bolivar, near the mouth
of the Orinoco. He had amassed a little
fortune by trading with the Indians. He spoke
their dialect, and practised polygamy in accordance
with their unsophisticated rites and
customs. It was said that he had a great
number of children along the shores of the
river; he could therefore recommend us to his
family, so to speak. His name was Gondelles.
He had often accompanied the missionaries
who had attempted to preach the Gospel among
the savages, and, unless Rumour was a lying
jade, he had himself strenuously endeavoured
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
to observe that Divine precept which refers to
increasing and multiplying the human species!</p>
<p>The Indians of this region are specially
expert in weaving beautiful hammocks from
fibres of the various kinds of <i>maguey</i> or <i>agave</i>
plants, or else extracted from the leaves of the
<i>moriche</i>. The most prized, however, are those
made of fibre of the <i>cumare</i> palm, soft and
pliant as silk. A large and comfortable
hammock woven of this fibre will take up the
smallest possible space and last longer than any
other. These Indians are also skilled in canoe-making;
with their primitive stone instruments,
aided by fire, they will make admirable canoes
of one piece, hewn from the trunk of a tree.
These canoes at times are so large that they
will seat from twenty to twenty-five men comfortably,
but most of them are small craft
easily handled, holding six or eight persons
at most.</p>
<p>Some of the men who had accompanied us
thus far now refused to continue the journey.
We were informed that it would be comparatively
easy to replace them with Indians
who would accompany us for four or five days
at a trifling wage. The tribes being numerous,
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
it would not be difficult to find new hands at
each stage.</p>
<p>The wage of our new canoe men was always
paid in kind: a handkerchief, a pound of
salt, an empty bottle, a strip of gaudy silk&mdash;we
had still some London cravats&mdash;were the
most coveted articles. The idea of equity and
work done for value received does not exist
amongst the Indians. We soon found that
it was folly to give them the article agreed
upon until the work was done; for once the
men had received what they coveted, they would
abandon us, stealthily leaving the camp in the
dusk at the first landing, and sometimes even
rushing into the jungle in broad daylight.</p>
<p>So now with a full crew, now crippled, we
managed to continue the journey, first for six
days on the Muco, and then on the Vichada,
the navigation of which proved to be much
longer than we had expected.</p>
<p>The general aspect of Nature on these two
rivers differed very little from what we had
seen on the Meta. The shores of the Muco
are generally covered with mangroves that
push far into the current their submerged network
of roots and branches, of which one must
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
steer clear, as they are hiding-places for snakes,
and are apt, if struck unexpectedly, to capsize
the canoes. These beautiful clear waters, so
harmless, so placid, in appearance, are in truth
full of danger. Apart from alligators and water
snakes, they abound in a species of small fish
called <i>caribe</i>, which attack men and animals,
especially if they find a sore spot in the skin.
They swarm in such quantities and are so
voracious that a bull or a horse crossing the
river, if attacked by these fish, may lose a leg,
or receive such a deep wound in the body that
death is inevitable. No less perilous is the
electric eel, which, on being touched, gives
a shock so strong that the man or animal receiving
it generally falls into the stream. Even
tigers are known to have been struck by these
peculiar fish, and it is said that some have been
drowned, being unable to recover themselves
in time.</p>
<p>During the month of January the turtles
begin to lay their eggs. Our attention was
called to a specially bright star in the horizon,
which the men asserted only appeared in that
month of the year. It was called the star of
the <i>terecayes</i>. The <i>terecay</i> is a small species of
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
turtle, and much prized, and with reason, on
account of its exquisite flesh. On more than
one occasion, quite unexpectedly, the canoes
would be steered ashore, the men would jump
on the sand and run as if guided by some well-known
landmark. After a few yards they would
stop, and, digging in the sand with their hands,
would extract a nest full of <i>terecay</i> eggs, the
contents varying from fifty to over a hundred.
Their experienced eyes had seen the tracks of
the <i>terecay</i> on the sand. These turtles, like all
others, lay their eggs once a year on the sand,
and cover them up carefully, leaving the cares
of motherhood to the forces of Nature. Once
hatched in this fashion, the young turtles must
shift for themselves, and their instinct tells
them that their numerous enemies lie in watch
for their awakening to active life. The moment
they break the shell they make as quickly as
they can for the neighbouring waters, where
they are comparatively safe.</p>
<p>If the inhabitants of those regions lack book-learning
and knowledge of things in which
their more civilized fellow-creatures are versed,
Nature and the life which they lead have given
them a keenness of sight, of hearing, and of
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
touch far beyond the average citizen of town
and village. I often noticed of an evening, as
the canoes were being tied and hoisted halfway
out of the water, that the men walking along
the beach would mutter to themselves, or call
the attention of their fellows to the sand, which
to me seemed smooth and uniform. Pointing
to the ground, they would say, duck, turtle,
tapir, alligator, wild-boar, deer, tiger, and so
forth. The tracks which they saw were, so to
speak, the visiting-cards of animals which had
spent the day on the beach where our camp
was pitched at night.</p>
<p>When we first came in contact with a real
wild Indian I experienced a feeling very difficult
to describe.</p>
<p>Here was a being whose appearance was
identical with our own, save for details of colour
of skin and other trivial distinctions which
could not affect the essential organic elements;
yet he awakened within us a curiosity akin to
that with which we gaze at a wild animal in
some zoological garden. What a deep gulf
yawned between that forlorn brother and ourselves!
The work of generations, the treasures
heaped up by man for man during centuries of
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
struggle and endeavour, hopes and fears, disappointments,
traditions, ideals, conventionalities,
all that constitutes civilization; the higher
belief in a Supreme Being, the evolution of
habits, the respect for established laws and
regulations, the reverence for sacred things&mdash;all
that world essential to us was as naught,
absolutely non-existent, for that naked fellow-creature
who stood before us, unprotected, lost
amid the forest in a climate unfavourable to
man. There was no one to help him, or make
any effort to improve the natural forces within
him, none to lift his soul into a higher and
better world. Curiosity gave way to pity.
The labour of the missionary&mdash;of the ideal
missionary&mdash;became holier and greater in my
eyes. Here was a field of promising harvest
for a real worker.</p>
<p>One clear and fragrant night, when all the
camp slept, the bonfires half out, the river a few
feet off, as I lay awake thinking of the world to
which we belonged, so different from our present
surroundings, so distant that it seemed a far-off
cloud in the sky, something that had gone by,
and which could never be reached again, I
suddenly remembered the words uttered by one
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
of our men when we landed that afternoon upon
the beach. He had clearly enumerated a long
list of animals whose tracks were upon the very
sand covered by my body. Logic took possession
of my brain with overpowering rapidity.
The alligator, the tiger, and their numerous
companions have visited this beach; they may
again visit it during the night. What is to
hinder them from doing so; and in that case,
what is to protect me from their attack? Little
did I care for the wild-boar, the tapir, or the
deer&mdash;I knew they would be as scared of me as
I was of the other animals; and so, after this
attack of fright, my imagination worked till the
sweat began to run clammy on my forehead.
It seemed to me that from the neighbouring
forest a veritable Noah&rsquo;s-ark of living, rushing,
roaring, famished beasts, multiplied by my
fancy, and numerous as the progeny of
Gondelles, came upon us. I almost felt the
hot breath and saw the glistening eyes of the
tiger outside the thin partition of cotton of my
mosquito-bar, heard the awkward shamble of
the alligator&rsquo;s body, and felt the unpleasant,
musky odour of the huge lizard an instant
before it crushed my bones between its jaws.
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
Unable to master myself, I sat upright, and
would have yelled from dread but for the
spectacle that met my eyes in the moonlight,
flooding the surrounding scene. There to right
and left of me snored all my companions; the
river shone brilliantly, the breeze blew softly,
no one stirred. This absence of fear on the
part of those who were perfectly familiar with
all the dangers of the region reassured me
completely. Oh blessed snores and valiant
snorers! My peace of mind returned, and,
lying back upon my sandy couch, I lustily
joined the tuneful choir.</p>
<p>Community of danger constitutes the most
acceptable guarantee; no man ever thinks of
ascertaining who drives the locomotive that is
to whirl him and hundreds of his fellow-creatures
at lightning speed through glade and
forest, over bridge and under tunnel; no man
questions the capability of the captain responsible
for the steamship and for the lives of
thousands of his fellow-men; the most distrustful
of us never gives a thought to these
points. Why? Because we know that the
driver or the captain, as the case may be,
stakes his own life. Each humble boatman
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
who listened to C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s proud assurance that
the skiff could not sink because it carried him
and all his fortunes equalled C&aelig;sar in self-esteem,
for the lives of those poor mariners were
as dear to them as C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s life could be to him.
The truth of my assertion that community of
danger constitutes the acceptability of a given
guarantee is demonstrated when, for instance,
a traveller entrusting his life on a railway or a
ship to the agent of a company advances or
lends money to the same company. Then
comes the hour of discrimination. All the
appliances invented by that most wonderful
engine of human ingenuity, the law of commerce,
which in its numerous forms rules the
world paramount and supreme, are brought to
bear. No one&rsquo;s word is accepted as sufficient;
documents, signatures, seals, formalities,
numerous and complicated, are employed as a
delicate proof of the trust that the man of the
world ever places in the good faith of his
brother before God. This suspicion is responsible
for an enormous amount of expense and
trouble which, were good faith more abundant
or were belief in its existence general, might
be applied to relieve misery and sorrow. If
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
the action of humanity all the world over in
this dreary endeavour to protect man from the
rascality of man be justified, we are, indeed,
not very far removed in truth and in essence
from the savages of the forest, who seize what
they need and prey upon each other according
to the dictates of nature. If beauty be but
skin-deep, civilization is not more profoundly
ingrained, and the smallest rub reveals the
primitive ravening beast. Yet I may be mistaken;
perhaps it is not distrust which begets
all those precautions, but something so noble
that I dare not presume to divine, much less
to understand, it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>Though several years have elapsed since my
journey across those wild vast regions, the
remembrance of them is most vivid and clear
in my mind. It seems to me that everything
in that period of my life, landscape and human
beings, forest and plain, stream and cloud,
mountains and breezes, all, all are still alive;
they form part of the panorama or scene wherein
my memory keeps them immortal, abiding for
ever as I saw them, though unattainable to me.
What was, is; what was, must be; so I imagine.
Memory is in this respect like the artist. The
sculptor or the painter seizes one moment of
life, fashions and records it in marble or in
bronze, in line or colour, and there it remains
defying time, unchanging and unchangeable.
The gallery of the mind, the vast storehouse
of the past, is infinite. It keeps in its inmost
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
inexhaustible recesses the living record of our
life, the tremulous shadowy hues of early night
deepening into the dark, the glory of the
rising sun casting its veil of light upon the
waves, the sensation of the breeze as it fans
our heated brow after an anxious night, the
thunder of the ocean or the deafening tumult
of frenzied crowds in hours of national misfortune
or universal anger, the last parting word
or look of those who are gone before, the blithe
greeting of him who comes back to us after
years of absence and of sorrow: all these
manifestations of life, the ebb and flow of joy
and happiness, of pain and grief, stand individualized,
so to speak, in the memory, and
nothing, save the loss of memory itself, can
change them. Nothing so dear to the heart
as those treasures; against them time and the
vicissitudes of life are powerless&mdash;even as the
lovers and the dancers and the singers and
the enchanted leafy forest in Keats&rsquo; &lsquo;Grecian
Urn.&rsquo; That love will know no disappointment.
Sweet as songs heard may be, far sweeter are
those unheard of human ear; beautiful as are
the green boughs of the forest, far lovelier
are those whose verdure is imperishable, whose
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
leaves will know no autumn; and sweeter than
all melody, the unheard melody of those flutes,
dumb and mute in the infinite harmony which
man can imagine, but not create. Our own
mind keeps that record of the past; hallowed
and sacred should it be, for therein our sorrow
may find relief, and our joy purity and new
strength.</p>
<p>Beautiful indeed were our days. Gliding
softly over the waters, we would read, and
there, in forced and intimate communion with
Nature, would seek our old-time friends the
historians, the poets, the humbler singers that
had charmed, or instructed, or taught us how
to live. The lessons of history seemed clearer
and more intelligible, the puissant and sonorous
voice of poetry sounded fitly under that blue
sky in the midst of those forests, even as the
notes of the organ seem to vibrate and echo
as in their very home, under the fretted vault
of some Gothic temple. The majesty of surrounding
Nature lent an additional charm to the
voice of the great ones who had delivered a
message of consolation and of hope to mankind.
We lived now in Rome, now in Greece, now
in modern Europe, and frequently the songs
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
of our own poets filled our minds with joy, as
the twitter of native birds when the sun rose
and the morning sparkled, bedewed with jewels
that night had left on leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>One day, when we had grown expert in
bargaining with the Indians, shortly before
sunset a solitary Indian paddled towards our
camp. He had been attracted by the novel
sight. We had learnt that within the memory
of living man no such large convoy as ours had
passed through those waters; groups of eight
or ten men in one canoe were the largest ever
seen&mdash;at least, the largest groups of strangers.
Here was a small army, with two large canoes
and great abundance of strange and wonderful
equipment&mdash;boxes, trunks, weapons, cooking
utensils, many men with white faces and
marvellous strange array; indeed, enough to
attract the attention and curiosity of any child
of the forest. The canoe upon which the
Indian stood was barely six feet in length&mdash;so
narrow and shallow that at a distance he seemed
to stand on the very mirror of the waters. He
carried a large paddle, shaped like a huge rose-leaf
somewhat blunted at the end, and with a
very long stem. He plunged this gracefully in
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
the water on either side, seeming hardly to
bend or to make any effort, and in feathering
there appeared a convex mirror of liquid glass,
upon which the sunlight fell in prismatic hues
each time that his paddle left the water. He
drew near, and stood before us like a bronze
statue. He was stark naked, save for a clout
round his loins. On his brow was a crown of
tiger-claws surmounted by two eagle feathers.
Across his neck, hung by a string, was a small
bag of woven fibre containing a piece of salt,
some hooks made of bone and small harpoons
which could be set on arrows, and two hollow
reeds about an eighth of an inch in diameter
and four or five inches long. By means of
these reeds the Indians inhale through their
nostrils an intoxicating powder, in which they
delight. The man was young, powerfully built,
about five feet ten in height, and well proportioned;
his teeth glistening and regular; his
eyes black and large, gleaming like live coals;
he was a perfect incarnation of the primitive
race, and the hardships and exposure of his
past life had left no more trace on him than the
flowing waters of the river on the swan&rsquo;s-down.</p>
<p>Guided by our civilized instinct, which in
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
these utilitarian days prompts man to seek in
whatever meets his eye, first and foremost, not
its beauty or the symbol which it may represent,
or the tendency towards something higher
which it may indicate, but its utility, following
this delightful system of our latest Christian
civilization, I, in common with my companions,
at once decided to exploit that simple spirit and
press him into our service. Being unable to
bargain ourselves&mdash;which was lucky for him,
for in our enlightened way we should have
driven a harder bargain than our men&mdash;we
entrusted the task to Leal.</p>
<p>The Indian, also true to his instinct, immediately
indicated&mdash;first by signs, and then
by word of mouth, when he saw he was understood&mdash;that
he craved a part of the innumerable
riches before his eyes. He really did not ask
for much; he wanted some salt, a knife, a piece
of glass like a small mirror that he saw glittering
in the hands of one of our men, and whatever
else we might be willing to give. He was
told that he could have all that he asked and
more. He smiled broadly, and a light of joy
came over his face. These were signs truly
human, not yet trained into the hypocritical
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
conventions of well-bred society. As he
stretched forth his hand, he was told that the
gift was conditional&mdash;that he must earn the
articles he coveted, that we expected him to
sit beside the other paddlers and help to carry
us for two or three days, whereupon he would
receive these rich gifts from our prodigal
bounty.</p>
<p>This statement seemed to our Indian interlocutor
absurd, just as something utterly incongruous
and ludicrous in business would
strike the mind of a London banker. In his
primitive mental organism the idea that one
man should work for another was something
that found no place. Those forests, rivers, and
plains were his home; he roved free and fearless
through them, alone or in the company of
others, each one of whom provided for himself.
A bargain&mdash;that basis of civilization, of culture,
that great agent of progress and of human
development&mdash;was something which he could
not understand. The essence of the fact, and
the fact itself, were beyond him. We could see
the struggle between his greed and his love of
freedom. The riches that we offered him
tempted him far more than glittering diamonds
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
on the counter of a jeweller tempt a vain
woman or a burglar at bay. Yet he overcame
the temptation. The glad smile vanished; his
face darkened with a look that we could interpret
as reproach, and possibly contempt; he silently
lifted his paddle, and with two strokes sped his
canoe into mid-stream. Without glancing backwards,
giving now and then a tremendous
stroke, he disappeared in the distance. The
rays of the sinking sun reddened the waters
of the river and the surrounding horizon; the
Indian, upright in his canoe, seemed as if clad
in a sheet of flame, and finally vanished as
though consumed in the crimson glow. The
sun itself in the western horizon resembled a
huge ball of red-hot iron, as if the Cyclops and
the Titans, after playing, had left it behind on
the bosom of the endless plain, flat and still as
the sea in a calm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>The course of the rivers on the <i>llanos</i> is far
from being as straight as the proverbial path
of righteousness. They meander, wind, and
turn about, so that when on a sharp curve one
often sails almost directly against the main
direction of the waters. The Indians take
short cuts overland which enable them to
travel much faster than the canoes. Thus the
news of our coming preceded us by several
days, and long before we reached the mouth
of the Vichada all the tribes had heard that the
largest expedition known in their history was
on the way.</p>
<p>For reasons which he explained to us afterwards,
Leal had, without consulting us, informed
the first Indians whom we met that ours was
a party of missionaries. I do not suppose that
he went into any further details. In the mind
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
of the Indians the remembrance of missionaries
seems to have lingered from the days when
Jesuit missions were established on nearly all
the principal rivers of the Orinoco watershed.
From the time of the Independence there have
been no regular missions following a consistent
plan and belonging to a special organization.
Now and then desultory attempts have been
made without any appreciable results. But the
Indians respect the missionary; possibly they
also fear him, and, as we could observe later on
from our own experience, they expect from him
gifts not only of a spiritual, but of a material
kind.</p>
<p>The result of all this is that a missionary is
more likely to be welcomed and assisted than
any other traveller. This was what guided
Leal in what he considered a harmless assertion&mdash;a
pious fraud, in which the fraud is more
obvious than the piety.</p>
<p>Be it remarked, however, that neither my
companions nor I had the least responsibility
for Leal&rsquo;s action. When travelling along the
mule-tracks leading to the plains, public opinion,
or what under the existing circumstances took
its place, had assigned to our expedition an
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
episcopal character. This assimilation to the
Church seemed to have been our fate. Here
again we were incorporated in its fold in an
official capacity, so to speak, without the least
intention or effort on our part. When we learnt
what Leal had done, it was too late to withdraw,
and we resigned ourselves to our new ecclesiastical
honours with proper humility.</p>
<p>It is said that men may be great, some because
they are born great, others because they achieve
greatness, and others yet again because greatness
is thrust upon them. In the present
instance the clerical character was thrust upon
us. We&mdash;at least, I can answer for myself&mdash;tried
to live up to the new dignity, not only
inwardly, but outwardly, assuming, as far as
circumstances would permit, the sedate and
reverent, contemplative demeanour which so
well suits him who devotes his life to the
welfare of others, seeking to guide them to
heaven by an easy path, no matter at what
cost of personal sacrifice or discomfort to himself.</p>
<p>Strange, however, that this self-sacrificing
mood adopted in imitation of true priests, who
despise the comforts and joys of life, should
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
have been assumed in our own spurious case
for the special purpose of increasing those
worldly comforts and material joys!</p>
<p>We soon discovered, to our amazement, that
our new position was far from being a sinecure.</p>
<p>One day we were waiting for the noon-day
heat to pass, having halted on a <i>poyata</i>, the
name given to small beaches that seem to
stretch like a tongue of sand from under the
very roots of the forest into the river; we had
fled for shelter to the coolness of the high
vaulting trees, from whose trunks the hammocks
swung invitingly. The blue heaven appeared
like an enamelled background beyond the lace-work
of the intertwined leaves and branches.
The fires burned brightly and cheerily, their
flames pale and discoloured in the bright glare
of the sun; the pots simmered, and soon tempting
whiffs were wafted by the lazy breeze that
hardly stirred, welcome heralds of good things
to come. The stomach reigns supreme just
before and after a meal, which, if it be assured
to a hungry mortal, constitutes for him the
most satisfactory event in the immediate future,
calming his anxieties or blunting the edge of
care; and after it has been eaten, the process
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
of digestion, which for the moment monopolizes
the principal energies of the organism, seems
to cast a veil over the unpleasant aspects of
life, and to soften the thorns that beset our
path.</p>
<p>Some General of the Confederate Army in
the United States, who had retired to his lands
after the final collapse of the South, used to
remark that one of the saddest things for an
old man who had been very active in former
years was to receive the frequent news of the
death of former comrades and companions.
&lsquo;Whenever such news reaches me,&rsquo; he went
on to say, &lsquo;I always order two pigeons for my
dinner; they are so soothing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of our pleasant expectations we
found ourselves suddenly invaded by a swarm
of Indians, male and female of all ages, who
came either from the forest or in canoes. They
pounced on us so swiftly that we were practically
swamped by them in an instant. They at once
began to beg for presents, to touch and smell
any of the articles belonging to us that they
could, and they certainly would have taken
everything had it been possible.</p>
<p>The men were all in the primitive attire of
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
the proud Indian whom we had been unable
to press into our service a few days before.
The women wore tunics made either from coarse
cotton stuffs obtained from the traders, or from
a sort of bark, pliant and fairly soft, called
<i>marimba</i>. Some of the women were accompanied
by two or three children.</p>
<p>With the tribe&mdash;for it was a whole tribe that
had fallen upon us&mdash;came a man dressed in
trousers&mdash;the regulation article such as you
may see in any civilized capital&mdash;and a woollen
shirt of a deep red hue. He was the chief of
the tribe, and had donned that garb in our
honour.</p>
<p>The captain told Leal that the various
mothers who had brought their children were
anxious to have them baptized. Leal replied
that the matter would be attended to on our
return trip, arguing furthermore that the three
reverend missionaries should not be disturbed
as they lay in their hammocks, for though, had
they been ordinary men, they might be thought
to be asleep, yet being persons of eminent piety
it was more probable that they were entranced
in meditation. Leal backed his plea with a
gift, a most wonderful argument which carries
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
conviction to wild Indians almost as quickly as
to civilized men. The chief did not insist, and
for the moment we were left to our pseudo-religious
and silent contemplations.</p>
<p>Shortly after, however, an Indian mother,
with one child in her arms and two in her
wake, proved obdurate and relentless. Her
thirst for the baptismal waters&mdash;at least, on
behalf of her children if not of herself&mdash;must be
slaked at all costs. All Leal&rsquo;s efforts proving
fruitless, he ended by telling her that I was the
chief missionary. Once recognised as a pillar
of the Church, I was prepared for any sacrifice
of self, so that on the Indian woman approaching
me I got ready to perform whatever
ceremony she might want to the best of my
ability. She was not only prudent and cautious,
but distrustful. She pulled my hat off, and ran
her fingers swiftly through my hair. On seeing
that I had no tonsure&mdash;her mimic was as clear
as speech&mdash;she flung my hat violently on the
ground, gesticulated and shouted, attracting
the attention of all her companions.</p>
<p>Here was a complication for which we had
not bargained. If there were great advantages
in our being taken for missionaries, there was
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
also great danger in being exposed as sham
missionaries. Something must be done to
remedy the evil. Leal at once bethought
himself of an expedient; he took the Indian
woman towards the hammock where Alex
slept in sweet oblivion, unconscious of what
was going on around him. She at once
dragged off his hat, and on finding a head brilliantly
bald almost fell prostrate. Hierarchy,
or what in her savage mind stood for it,
evidently grew higher with the size of the
tonsure, and here the tonsure was immense.
Had she known the various dignities into which
the Catholic priesthood is divided, she might
have taken Alex for the Pope. Be that as it
may, she was satisfied. Alex, on being informed,
swallowed the pill gracefully, and
prepared to do his duty.</p>
<p>The woman brought forward her smallest
child. Here again new difficulties ensued.
We held a council of consultation as to the
<i>modus operandi</i>. Opinions differed widely, and
were supported vehemently, as is sure to be
the case when all those discussing a given
subject happen to be equally ignorant. Finally
some sort of plan was adopted, and the child
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
was baptized in accordance with a rite evolved
from our own dim recollections, with such
modifications as seemed most fit.</p>
<p>There under the blue heaven, with the broad
winding river at our feet, close by the dense,
darkening forest that lay behind us, its branches
overhead forming a panoply of green, studded
with the gold and yellow and blue flowers of
the numerous creepers, we performed the
ceremony of baptism, initiating the young
savage into the Church of Christ our Lord
with a feeling of deep reverence, intensified by
our own sense of ignorance. Let us hope that
the solemnity of the act, which flashed before
us like an unexpected revelation, compensated
for any involuntary informality.</p>
<p>But after the water had been poured on the
babe&rsquo;s head, and the ceremony had, as we
thought, come to an end, the mother would not
take her child back. She had evidently seen
other baptisms, and our christening was not up
to her standard. She made us understand that on
former occasions &lsquo;book reading&rsquo; had taken place:
such was Leal&rsquo;s interpretation of her words.</p>
<p>We had come to look upon this Indian
woman as an expert critic. Through unpardonable
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
neglect, which to this day I cannot
explain satisfactorily, we had neither a breviary
nor a prayer-book with us, so we laid hands on
the next best thing, bearing in mind what a
stickler for detail this Indian woman had proved
to be. A book of poems, an anthology of
Spanish poets, gilt-edged and finely bound,
stood us in good service. Alex opened it at
random, and read a short poem with due and
careful elocution for the edification of the new
little Christian.</p>
<p>The ceremony had to be performed eight or
ten times. After the third child we gave them
only one stanza apiece, as our ardour was somewhat
chilled.</p>
<p>When all the children had been christened,
the chief claimed the &lsquo;usual&rsquo; gifts. He soon
explained to us that it was customary for the
missionaries to make presents to the parents of
the children newly baptized. I had begun to
admire the zeal of these mothers in quest of a
higher religion for their children; this demand
showed that their fervour was accompanied by
greed, being thus of the same nature as that
species of &lsquo;charity with claws&rsquo;&mdash;the Spanish
<i>caridad con u&ntilde;as</i>. Trifles were distributed
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
amongst the mothers, and the tribe disappeared,
rejoicing in their possessions, for to
these folk the things were no trifles, and, let us
hope, exultant in the acquisition of eight or ten
buds destined to bloom into Christian flowers.</p>
<p>History doth indeed repeat itself, and
humanity imitates humanity heedless of time
and space. If I remember rightly, Clovis,
justly anxious for the conversion of his legions
to Christianity, presented each dripping warrior
after baptism with a tunic&mdash;a most valuable
article in those days, when Manchester looms
did not exist and all weaving was done by
hand. Those pious paladins, it is said, were
like our Indian friends of the Vichada, always
ready to be rechristened on the same terms as
before&mdash;that is to say, in exchange for a new
tunic. Yet, for all their sameness, things do
somehow change with time. In these two
instances we have the Church as a donor, and
the new proselyte as a receiver of presents
more or less valuable. Once the conversion
fully assured, what a change in the parts within
a few generations! The Church gives naught;
at least, it gives nothing that is of this world.
On the contrary, it takes all it can; the people
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
are led to heaven, the poorer the easier, for in
the kind and capacious bosom of Mother
Church they are to deposit all worldly goods
which might hamper their flight to higher
regions. A beautiful and wonderful evolution,
and we had not far to go to see it in full play
and force. The savages of the Colombian
plains are still in that primitive pitiful state
when they have to be bribed, so to say, into
the fold of the Church; many of the civilized
people in the towns and cities obey and respect
that Church which holds sway supreme over
them in life and in death, guiding, controlling,
saving them. Happy the nations where the
chosen and appointed servants of the Most
High, disciplined into some sort of priesthood
or other, undertake the pleasing task of saving
their reluctant fellow-men at the latter&rsquo;s expense,
but with the sure and certain faith of
those who know that they are working for
justice and for the happiness of their fellows,
though these may choose to deny it. Happy,
thrice happy, lands where the invasion of
diabolical modern ideas has been baffled, and
the good old doctrine of abject submission still
rules!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>Whenever we started afresh in the morning, or
after any temporary halt, the man at the prow
of the canoe would call out, &lsquo;<i>Vaya con Dios</i>,&rsquo;
and the man on the stern, who steered with a
paddle far larger than the others, would reply,
&lsquo;<i>y con la Virgen</i>&rsquo; (&lsquo;God go with us,&rsquo; &lsquo;and the
Virgin,&rsquo; respectively). The fair Queen of
Heaven, being thus commemorated, piety was
wedded to chivalry.</p>
<p>The days followed each other in seemingly
endless succession, like the windings of the
river. Familiarity with the ever-varying
aspects of Nature begot a sense of monotony
and weariness. The forests and the prairies,
dawn and sunset, the whole marvellous landscape,
passed unheeded. We longed to reach
the main artery; the Orinoco was our Mecca,
apparently unattainable. Fishing and hunting
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
had lost zest, and become simple drudgery,
indispensable to renew our provender, as in
the long journey nearly all our stores were
exhausted.</p>
<p>Raoul and Leal frequently shot at the alligators,
which, singly, in couples, or in shoals,
basked in the sun in a sort of gluttonous
lethargy, with hanging tongues and half-closed
eyes. The huge saurians, when hit, would turn
over and make for the water, except on rare
occasions when the bullet entered below the
shoulder-blade, this being a mortal wound.</p>
<p>We would sit listening to the even stroke of
the paddles on the sides of the canoe and the
drowsy sing-song of the men.</p>
<p>Frequently, towards sundown, we heard the
deep note of tigers in the forest, and always the
confused uproar of a thousand animals, frogs,
crickets, birds, ushering in the night.</p>
<p>Besides alligators and wild-boar, the only
other large animals which we frequently saw
were the harmless tapirs.</p>
<p>Snakes are not abundant on the Vichada, yet
it was on the shores of that river that we came
to quite close quarters with a water-snake of
the boa constrictor species. The reptile was
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
found coiled not far from our halting-place.
Raoul at once fired his fowling-piece at short
range, blinding and wounding it. He then
discharged the five bullets of his revolver into
the snake, and the men completed the work,
beating it with their paddles. When stretched
out, it measured some 16 feet in length, and was
of corresponding thickness.</p>
<p>These snakes, though not poisonous, are
dangerous if hungry. They lurk at the
drinking-places, and when a young calf, deer,
or any other small animal comes within reach,
they coil themselves round it and strangle it.
They devour their prey slowly, and then fall
into a sleep, which is said to last for several days.</p>
<p>In all probability, the snake we had killed
must have been at the end of one of these
periods. Much to our astonishment, notwithstanding
bullets and blows, the snake began to
move in the direction of our hammocks. Had
this not been seen in time, it might possibly
have coiled itself around some unwary sleeper.
More blows were administered, and this time
the animal seemed quite dead. However, it
managed to roll into the river, and on striking
the water appeared to revive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>This was our only meeting face to face with
a denizen of these forests and rivers, and
I can truly say we longed for no closer acquaintance
with them.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons of prudence, we soon
made up our minds never to pitch our night
camp on beaches easy of access to the Indians
settled along the shores, but during the day we
would frequently halt at their settlements, and
this enabled us to see a good deal of their mode
of life and peculiarities.</p>
<p>We found the tribes docile and friendly,
rather inclined to be industrious in their way
than otherwise.</p>
<p>The Indians of the Vichada basin are the
bakers, if I may so call them, of that great
region. The bread which they prepare is made
from the <i>ma&ntilde;oc</i>, or <i>yuca</i>, root, which grows in
plenty along the banks of rivers and streams.
There are two kinds of <i>ma&ntilde;oc</i>, one sweet and
harmless, the other bitter and poisonous, yet it
is from this latter kind that the <i>casabe</i> is prepared.
The root, varying in length from
2 to 3 feet, with a thickness of from 1 to 3
inches, is grated on specially-prepared boards
of very hard wood. Thus a whitish pulp
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
is obtained, which is then compressed in a
most primitive manner. A hollow cylinder,
made of matting of coarse and pliant straw,
varying in length from 4 to 6, and sometimes
8, feet, and in diameter from 5 inches upwards,
is filled with the pulp, sausage-wise.
The cylinder is then hung from the branch of
a tree, or a beam conveniently upraised on a
frame; it is then stretched and twisted from
below. The juice of the pulp flows through the
mesh of the matting. When all the juice has
been extracted, the pulp is emptied into large
wooden basins, and is soaked in water, which is
run off, the operation being repeated several
times. The poisonous element, soluble in
water, is thus eliminated, and the pulp is
ready. It is then spread on a slab of stone,
thin and perfectly even, called <i>budare</i>, which
stands over a fire. The <i>casabe</i> is soon baked,
generally in round cakes from 12 to 18 inches
in diameter, and from half an inch to an inch in
thickness. After baking it is stored in special
baskets, called <i>mapires</i>, where it can be kept for
months, as it stands all weathers and is impervious
to moisture. It has the taste and the
consistency of sawdust, and hunger must be
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
very keen for any novice to relish the food.
Yet it is most nutritious, and after a while
replaces biscuit and bread, especially when
these are not to be found! Not only the
Indians, but even the white men, or those
who call themselves civilized in that vast
region, use <i>casabe</i> exclusively. Wheat flour is
soon spoiled in that hot, damp atmosphere,
where there are no facilities for protecting it
against moisture and vermin, and though corn
might be abundantly produced, there are no
mills to grind the meal. Population is so
scarce, and the few inhabitants are so far
apart, that it would not pay to set up the
necessary machinery. Nature seems to overwhelm
man, who drifts back easily into primitive
conditions of being.</p>
<p>The Indians also prepare <i>ma&ntilde;oc</i> flour. The
method is the same as in the case of <i>casabe</i>,
only that before baking the pulp is allowed to
ferment to a certain degree; after that it is
baked and reduced to powder. This powder,
mixed with water, makes an acid, refreshing
drink. If sugar or molasses be available, they
are added.</p>
<p>As I have said before, the Vichada Indians
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
are expert weavers of hammocks, and carvers
or makers of canoes. They fell a large tree,
and, after months of labour, produce very fine
canoes. The canoes, the hammocks, and the
<i>casabe</i> and <i>ma&ntilde;oc</i> are sold to traders who
realize large profits. A pair of trousers and
a hat to the captain of a tribe are deemed a
good price for a small canoe. Such articles as
a cutlass, or an axe, are most highly prized by
the Indians, and are paid for accordingly. It
is pitiful to learn how these poor savages are
cheated, when not robbed outright, by the
pseudo-Christians who come in contact with
them.</p>
<p>They also manufacture torches from resinous
substances extracted from the forests. Some
of these substances are excellent for caulking
purposes, and, as they are found in great abundance,
should constitute an important article of
trade. A torch made from <i>peraman</i> about
3 to 4 feet in length, lighted as night set in,
would burn with a brilliant yellow flame, and
throw a strong glare over the camp in the
small hours when the bonfires had been
reduced to embers.</p>
<p>We had been on the Vichada about twenty-five
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
days, when one of us developed symptoms
of fever, and as these increased within the next
twenty-four hours, we looked about for some
convenient spot where we might rest for a few
days, lest the attack might become really
serious. It was our intention to build up
some sort of hut&mdash;a comparatively easy matter,
as some of our men were old hands at that
kind of work. Fortunately for us, however,
we met coming from the mouth of the Vichada
a Venezuelan <i>ma&ntilde;oc</i> trader, who was sailing to
one of the Vichada affluents, where he expected
to receive a load of <i>ma&ntilde;oc</i> and <i>casabe</i>. The
man&rsquo;s name was Valiente. He had three
canoes and ten men with him. We were
delighted to meet him, as it had been impossible
for us to gather correct information from
the Indians.</p>
<p>He told us that we were still two or three
days&rsquo; journey from the Orinoco, advised us not
to put up at any of the beaches, but to push on
to within a few hours of the mouth of the
Vichada, where, on the left bank, we would
find an abandoned <i>caney</i> that had been built by
cattle-ranchers some years previously. He had
just been there. It was possible, he added,
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
that we might find some Indians in possession,
in which case we should enforce the right of
the white man and drive them out. At any
rate, the <i>caney</i> was on high ground, the forests
around were clear, and we should find it far
more comfortable than anywhere else in that
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Following his advice, we hurried on as fast
as we could, promising to wait for him at Santa
Catalina, that being the name of the place.
Valiente thought that he would start back in
six or eight days.</p>
<p>In due course we reached Santa Catalina.
On the high bluff, about 300 yards from the
shore, we saw the welcome outlines of a <i>caney</i>;
it showed unmistakable signs of having been
built by white men. We could see from the
river that it was inhabited. This was not so
pleasant, but we had made up our minds that
we would take possession of the <i>caney</i> with or
without the consent of its occupants. If soft
words proved insufficient, we were bound to
appeal to the last argument of Kings and of
men at bay&mdash;force.</p>
<p>I really did not feel inclined to violence;
peaceful means and diplomatic parleying seemed
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
to me preferable, but as we had no choice,
following the practice sanctioned by experience,
of preparing for war if you want to insure
peace, we decided to make a great display of
force, even as the Great Powers, with their
military and naval man&oelig;uvres&mdash;a show of teeth
and claws to overawe the occupants of the
<i>caney</i>.</p>
<p>We moored on the bank near by. Notwithstanding
my appearance, which, as I have
chronicled in these pages, had warranted the
belief in others that I belonged to the holiest
of human professions, I was told off to ascertain
whether we should occupy the premises peacefully
or by force. I donned a red shirt,
suspended from a broad leather belt a most
murderous-looking cutlass and a six-shooter,
cocked my hat sideways in a desperado fashion,
and, full of ardour, advanced, flanked on either
side by Leal and one of our men, each of
whom carried a rifle and the inevitable <i>machete</i>.
Verily, we looked like a wandering arsenal!</p>
<p>Remembering that the actor&rsquo;s success is said
to be greater the more he lives up to his part,
I endeavoured to look as fierce as possible,
and tried to call to mind scenes of dauntless
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
courage, assaults of fortresses, heroic deeds
from my historical repertory. I must have
succeeded, for I felt uncommonly brave, particularly
as there seemed to be no danger
warranting our preparations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I happen to be afflicted with
myopia, which at a certain distance blurs the
outline of objects large or small.</p>
<p>As we continued to advance I could distinguish
that someone was coming towards us.
My courage evaporated; I felt sure that this
must be some hostile Indian intent on hindering
our access to the longed-for <i>caney</i>. I would
fain have turned tail, but vanity, which is the
source of nine-tenths of the displays of human
courage, pricked me on. My ears awaited the
wild whoop of the advancing Indian, and my
eyes were prepared to witness the onslaught
of his ferocious braves from the neighbouring
bushes. Yet the die was cast, and forward
we went.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise when, from the approaching
figure, still indistinct and vague to
my short-sighted eyes, a greeting of the utmost
courtesy in the purest Castilian rang forth in the
air of the clear afternoon. I shall never forget
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
it. Those words in my native tongue, uttered
in the midst of that wilderness, 500 leagues
from the nearest town or civilized settlement,
conjured up in one moment cherished memories
of a distant world.</p>
<p>Greatly relieved, I put aside my weapons of
assault and destruction, which, to speak the
truth, were most inconvenient to walk in.</p>
<p>I knew before, and am more convinced than
ever since that day, that I am not compounded
of the clay of heroes: in which I am like the
rest of the world. Peace and peaceful avocations
are much more in my line. I love heroes&mdash;military
ones especially&mdash;in books, in pictures,
or in statues; as every-day companions, I believe&mdash;not
having met any heroes in the flesh&mdash;that
they must be unbearable. They really owe it
to themselves to get killed or to die the moment
they have attained their honours. They are
sure to be ruined if left to the vulgarizing
influences of daily life, mixing with the rest of
humanity in every-day toil and strife. You
cannot have your bust or portrait in Parliament
or Assembly, your niche in the cathedral or
in public hall, and your equestrian statue with
your horse eternally lifting his fore-legs for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
edification of coming generations, and at the
same time insist on walking about the streets in
the guise of a commonplace mortal! If you live
in bronze and marble, if your name fills half a
column of the encyclop&aelig;dia, and appears as a
noble example in the books in which children
are taught to consider brutal violence the
highest evolution of human intellect and action,
you cannot ask your humble companions on
earth to put up with you in their midst.
Heroes should find their places, and stick to
them, for their own greater glory and the
comfort of their fellow-men.</p>
<p>The gentleman whom we met was named
Aponte, and came from Caracas, the capital of
Venezuela. He had been appointed to the
governorship of the Amazon Territory. After
spending several years in its capital, San Carlos,
he became afflicted with cataract. People told
him that the Vichada Indians cured cataract
with the juice of certain herbs, which they kept
secret. He had arrived at Santa Catalina
about ten days before us, accompanied by his
sister and a young Corsican who had been in
his employ at San Carlos. An Indian woman
from one of the tribes had taken him in charge,
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
and made daily applications of some milky juice
extracted from plants, and, strange to say, he
found relief. I have since heard that he is
completely cured.</p>
<p>An occulist, who travelled through those
regions two or three years later, investigated
the truth of these alleged cures, and found them
to be authentic. He could not, however, induce
the Indians to tell him what they use. This
knowledge of the virtue of plants amongst the
Indians is found in nearly all tropical lands.
Quinine, to which humanity owes so much, was
also an Indian secret, and was discovered by
a well-known combination of circumstances.
Towards the middle of the eighteenth century,
in one of the Peruvian States, the Indians were
treated very cruelly by their masters. The
daughter of the house won the love of the
Indian slaves by her kindness and charity. It
had been noticed that no Indians died from
malarial and other fevers, which proved fatal to
the white men, but what means they employed
could not be learned either by threats or
entreaties.</p>
<p>The daughter of the cruel master was taken
ill. Her nurse, an Indian woman, gave her
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
some concoction which saved her life, but would
not reveal the secret for years. On her deathbed
she told her young mistress what plant it
was that the Indians employed against fever.
Thus the <i>cinchona</i>, or Peruvian bark, was discovered.
In the Choco regions in Colombia,
which teem with snakes, the Indians know not
only the plants that cure the bite and counteract
the poison, but those which confer immunity.
They also have a combination of substances
forming a sort of paste, which, when applied to
the wounds and ulcers of man or animal, however
sore they may be, exercise a healing and
immediate action.</p>
<p>I had an uncle, Dr. Triana, well known to
European botanists, and especially to collectors
of orchids, to several varieties of which his
name is linked (the numerous varieties of
<i>Catleya trianensis</i> are named after him). He
lived for a long time in the Choco region, and
brought back large quantities of this paste,
which he used with success in cases of wounds
and ulcers, both in Europe and America, but he
could never persuade the Indians to tell him its
exact composition.</p>
<p>The young Corsican whom we found with
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
Mr. Aponte was a sort of globe-trotter, jack-of-all-trades,
hail-fellow-well-met with everybody.
He was an explorer, a dentist, could serve as
barber if required, had acted as clerk to Mr.
Aponte, had with him a fairly well-stocked
medicine-chest, and proved to be a first-rate
cook. He either knew something of medicine
or made up for ignorance by his daring. At
any rate, he took our sick companion in hand,
administered to him some of his drugs, and in
two or three days restored him to perfect health.
This was a great blessing. Thus disappeared
from our horizon the only ominous cloud which
darkened it during those days of so much sunlight
and freedom. Those who know not what
tropical fevers are can form no idea of the dread
that their presence inspires when one sees them
stealthily gaining ground. At times they act
slowly, and give one a chance of struggling
against them, but often they develop with
lightning rapidity, and a man in full health and
in the bloom of life is cut down suddenly in a
few days or in a few hours.</p>
<p>Figarella was the name of the Corsican
&lsquo;doctor&rsquo; who enlivened the few days we spent
at Santa Catalina with his songs, his tales of
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
Corsica, the narrative of his adventures, true
and fanciful, in all parts of the world, and who
managed to prepare sumptuous dinners with
turtle eggs, wild-boar meat, fresh fish, and
other ingredients, picked up the Lord only
knows where. I often had qualms that he
must be drawing too freely on his medicine-chest,
but the dishes proved palatable, and as
we survived from day to day we have nothing
but thanks and gratitude to the friend whom
we met in the midst of those wilds, with whom
our lives came in contact for a few days, who
then remained behind to work out his own
destiny, as we ours, even as two ships that
sight each other for a moment in mid-ocean
and then both disappear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>Friend Valiente turned up at Santa Catalina,
his canoes laden with <i>ma&ntilde;oc</i> and	<i>casabe</i>, two
days after our arrival.</p>
<p>Though the ranch had been abandoned for
some time, stray cattle, more or less wild,
roamed about the neighbourhood. Leal and
Valiente soon lassoed a fine heifer, which,
slaughtered without delay, replenished our
commissariat. We celebrated a banquet like
that held on New Year&rsquo;s Day at San Pedro
del Tua. We still had a little coffee, but of
rum, which had then formed such an attraction,
only the fragrant memory remained. Its place
was supplied with what was left of our last
demijohn of aniseed <i>aguardiente</i>.</p>
<p>As Valiente intended following the same
route, we decided to wait for him. He knew
that part of the Vichada and the Orinoco well.
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
There were several small rapids which it was
not advisable to cross without a pilot.</p>
<p>Two days after leaving Santa Catalina we
struck the Orinoco, with a feeling of boundless
joy. It seemed to us as if we had reached the
open ocean, and the air itself appeared purer,
more charged with invigorating oxygen.</p>
<p>After a short spin from the mouth of the
Vichada, we reached Maipures, where Venezuelan
authorities were stationed. Knowing
that Venezuelans, as a rule, are inclined to be
less reverent and respectful towards the Church
and its servants than the average Colombian,
we abandoned our ecclesiastical character, dropping
it, as Elias dropped his mantle upon
earth, on the waters of the Vichada, where it
had done us such good service.</p>
<p>It was indispensable that we should find a
pilot for the rapids. It seems that in former
days the Venezuelan Government kept two or
three pilots at Maipures, but we found to our
sorrow that they had disappeared long since.
However, not far from Maipures we were told
that we should find a man named Gati&ntilde;o, one
of the best pilots on the river. We at once
started in quest of him, and found him in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
thick of the forest about a mile from the shore.
He was gathering tonga beans, and had formed
a little camp, accompanied by his family, which
consisted of his wife, two children, a boy and
girl of fourteen and twelve respectively, and
two smaller children of five and six. He
agreed to take us across the rapids, provided
we would wait at Maipures until he could pack
his beans and gather some india-rubber extracted
by himself. As there was no help for
it, we agreed to wait. Maipures turned out to
be nothing but a group of some fifteen or
twenty tumble-down, rickety houses, inhabited
by about a score of people, amongst them
the prefect or political representative of the
Government. He received us most cordially,
and placed one of the buildings at our
service. I believe both Valiente and Leal
gave him to understand that we were high and
mighty personages representing the Colombian
Government on a tour of inspection through
the lands awarded to Colombia by a recent
decision in a case of arbitration between the
two republics, handed down by the Queen of
Spain. Maipures, where the functionary in
question was supreme, came within the new
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
jurisdiction, and possibly the belief that we
might exercise some influence in maintaining
him in his important office may have had to do
with his courtesy and goodwill towards us. It
was lucky, however, that such an impression
was created. Shortly after our arrival he informed
us that the Governor of the Amazon
territory had just communicated to him orders
to prevent all travellers on the river from
ascending or descending the stream&mdash;in a
word, to keep them as prisoners at Maipures.
On reading the Governor&rsquo;s note to us, he
argued, &lsquo;This cannot apply to you, for, being
Colombians, you are outside the Governor&rsquo;s
jurisdiction.&rsquo; Here, again, as when conferring
ecclesiastical dignity upon us, Leal had acted
with prudence and foresight.</p>
<p>At Maipures we felt, as we never felt before
or after during the journey, the presence of
the numerous insects, and noticed that these
winged creatures worked with method and
discipline. The <i>puyon</i> sounded the charge
shortly after sunset, attacking without haste
and without rest during the whole night. At
dawn it would retire to camp, sated with our
gore. The post of honour was taken by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
sand-flies, which would remain on duty during
the earlier part of the forenoon. In their turn
they were replaced by some other arm of the
service during the hot hours of the day, and so
on till nightfall, when the <i>puyon</i>, refreshed and
eager, would again fall upon his prey. There
is no greater regularity in the change of guards
at a fortress than is observed by these insects in
their war upon men and animals.</p>
<p>The mosquito-net was the only real protection.
Some relief is obtained by filling the
room with smoke from smouldering horse or
cattle manure, but the nauseous smell and the
ammonia fumes made the remedy worse than
the evil. We also feared to share the fate of
herrings and other fish subject to the process,
and preferred the seclusion of our mosquito-bars.</p>
<p>These, however, were all minor troubles,
mentioned here as a matter of record. From
our temporary abode we could hear the distant
thunder of the rapids, as of batteries of cannon
in a great artillery duel. The waters of the
Orinoco, suddenly twisted into a narrow bed,
wrestle with the boulders of granite scattered
in the channel, which they have frayed through
the very heart of the huge basaltic mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>Life in those regions, from what we gathered,
is as wild, as untamed, and irresponsible as the
rivers or forests, and as the animals that roam
in them. Violence and force are the only law,
greed is the sole guiding principle, amongst
men. The functionaries in most cases are only
authorized robbers and slayers. The Indians,
being the most helpless victims, are plundered
and murdered, as best suits the fancy of those representatives
of organized Governments, whose
crimes remain hidden behind the dense veil of
interminable forests.</p>
<p>When news of any of these misdeeds does
chance to reach the official ear, the facts are
so distorted on the one hand, and there is so
little desire to investigate on the other, that no
redress is ever obtained.</p>
<p>Whilst at Maipures there came in a man
from San Carlos, the capital of one of the
Amazon territories. He told a gruesome story.
The Governor of that province, whom he represented
as a prototype of the official robbers
just mentioned, had exasperated his companions
by his all-absorbing greed. The Governor
seized all the tonga beans and india-rubber extracted
by the poor Indians, who were forced
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
to work without any pay, unfed, whip-driven.
His companions, who expected a share in the
plunder, conspired to murder him. He was
known to be fearless and an admirable shot.
One night, however, his house was surrounded
by a score or so of his followers; a regular
siege ensued; the young Governor kept his
assailants at bay for several hours. He was
accompanied by a young Spanish ballet-dancer,
who had followed his fortunes undaunted by
the dangers of that wild land. She would reload
the guns whilst he scanned the ground
from the only window of the room. One of
the assailants crept upon the roof of the house
and shot him from behind. He died in a
few hours. The canoes laden with all kinds
of produce despatched by him&mdash;not down the
Orinoco, for he feared they might be seized
on the long journey through Venezuelan
territory, but through the Casiquiare to the
Amazon&mdash;were said to be worth &pound;40,000 or
&pound;50,000. Even if not accurate in all its
details, which I repeat from the statement of
the new arrival at Maipures, this instance gives
an idea of the conditions that prevail in those
localities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>True to his word, Gati&ntilde;o turned up at
Maipures on the third day, and we continued
our journey at once.</p>
<p>The rapids of the Orinoco break the open
current of the river for a distance of some forty
or fifty miles. The Maipures rapids are from
five to six miles in length. The river then
continues its quiet flow for about twenty or
twenty-five miles down to the rapids of Atures;
thence it flows to the ocean without any further
obstacle of importance.</p>
<p>Gati&ntilde;o had his own canoe of a special type,
much larger than ours, very deep, heavy,
capacious, and comfortable. It was the real
home of his family.</p>
<p>I asked him why he did not settle somewhere
on the banks of those rivers. He told
me that both on the Orinoco and on the
affluents there were numberless spots on high
ground, free from all floods, abundant in game,
within easy reach of good fishing, healthy and
cool, where he would fain settle. &lsquo;But we
poor wretches,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;have no rights.
When we least expect it, up turns a fine
gentleman sent by some Government or other
with a few soldiers; they lift our cattle and
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
steal our chickens, destroy what they do not
take away, and compel us to accompany them,
paddling their canoes or serving them as they
may want without any pay. Whenever I hear,&rsquo;
he went on to say, &lsquo;that white men in authority
are coming along the river, I start immediately
in my canoe through the <i>ca&ntilde;os</i> as far inland as
I can. The wild Indians and the savages are
kind and generous; it is the whites and the
whites in authority who are to be dreaded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gati&ntilde;o was himself a full-blooded Indian,
but, having been brought up on some settlement,
he considered himself a civilized man,
and in truth it was strange to see how he
practised the highest virtues of an honest man.
He loved his wife and family tenderly; he
worked day and night for their welfare. He
longed for a better lot for his children, the
eldest of whom &lsquo;studied&rsquo; at the city of San
Fernando de Atabapo, the only city which he
knew of by personal experience. As it consists
of eighty or a hundred thatch-roofed houses,
one may well imagine what the word &lsquo;city&rsquo;
implied in his case; yet his thoughts were
constantly centred on the learning which that
child was storing to the greater honour and
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
happiness of his wandering family. Reading
and writing formed the curriculum of that
university, possibly because they marked the
limit of the teacher&rsquo;s attainments; but let us
be ashamed of mocking the humble annals of
so good a man.</p>
<p>I cannot forbear mentioning an incident, a
parallel to which it would be difficult to find
amongst nominally civilized folk. One of our
men who had accompanied us from San Pedro
de Arimena, knowing our plight and our
dependence on Gati&ntilde;o, took him aside, informing
him that we had plenty of gold, and
that as one of us was ill, and we desired to
reach the open river as soon as possible, it
would be easy for him to name his price. He
suggested that Gati&ntilde;o should charge one or two
thousand dollars for the job, which we would be
bound to pay. Gati&ntilde;o not only did not improve
that wonderful opportunity, but he forbore from
telling us of the advice given to him. He
charged us 100 dollars, a moderate price for the
work, and it was only when on the other side of
the rapids that Leal learned the incident from
the other men.</p>
<p>Here was a test which not many men
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
brought up in the midst of civilized life could
have withstood.</p>
<p>Gati&ntilde;o and his family will ever remain in my
mind as a bright, cheerful group. Alas for
them, lost in those solitudes amongst wild
beasts and wild Indians, and subject to the
voracity of the white men, who become more
ferocious than the worst tiger when their unbridled
greed has no responsibility and no
punishment to dread!</p>
<p>We had three canoes (including Gati&ntilde;o&rsquo;s) to
take down. We were obliged to empty them
completely. The men carried everything on
their backs along the shore, whilst the canoes
shot the rapids.</p>
<p>When I saw Gati&ntilde;o on the first rapids, I
believed him to be bent on suicide. At that
point the river, cut and divided by the rocks,
left a narrow channel of about 300 feet in
length close in to the shore. Thus far the
canoes had been dragged by the current and
held by means of ropes. On reaching the
channel, Gati&ntilde;o manned the canoe with four
men at the prow, and sat at the stern. The
canoe, still tied by the rope, which was held by
four men, was kept back as much as possible
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
from the current, which increased in speed at
every inch. At the end of the channel the
whole river poured its foaming volume into a
huge, cup-like basin, studded with rocks, where
the water seethed as if boiling. From the basin
the river flowed on placidly for several miles.
This was the end of the first rapids.</p>
<p>Halfway down the channel the men let go
the ropes, and the canoe, with its crew, seemed
like a huge black feather upon a sea of foam,
and the whole length of the channel, white and
frothy, appeared like the arched neck of a
gigantic horse curved to drink from the waters
below. The waters, before entering the basin,
formed a small cataract shooting over the protruding
ledge. The canoe fell into the basin,
and seemed about to be dashed against a rock
that stood in its way. On again striking the
waters, Gati&ntilde;o gave the word of command, and
the four men began to paddle steadily and
with great force, as if to increase the impetus.
Gati&ntilde;o remained quiet and motionless in his
place, holding his paddle out of the water ready
to strike. At a given moment he uplifted it,
thrust it deeply into the waves, and moved it
dexterously, so that the canoe turned as if on a
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
pivot, and quietly glided along the rock upon
which it would have been dashed into a thousand
pieces.</p>
<p>Gati&ntilde;o explained to me that it was necessary
for the men to paddle so as to give the canoe
her own share in the impetus, and make it more
responsive to his steering.</p>
<p>Though he assured me that there was no
danger, and though the journey along the shore
was tiresome and slow, I did not venture to
accompany him when shooting the other rapids
before reaching the open river.</p>
<p>The Orinoco has drilled an open passage-way
through a spur of the mountains at Maipures.
The struggle between the waters and the rocks
must have lasted centuries.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here shalt thou halt,&rsquo; said the rock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Further will I go,&rsquo; replied the river.</p>
<p>Like the spoils of battle on a stricken field,
the shattered rocks stud the current, which
sweeps roaring and foaming around and over
them. They resemble the ruins in the breach
of a battered bastion. The river is the victor,
but, as will happen when two great forces
counteract each other, the result is a compromise,
and the course of the stream is
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
deviated. The difference of level from the
beginning to the end of the rapids is in itself
not sufficient to cause the violence with which
the waters run. It arises from the sudden
compression of the powerful volume of waters
into a narrow space. The waters rush through
the openings made in the rock with a deafening
sound, torn by the remnants of pillars in the bed
through which they pass. They fill the air with
the tumult of their advance; one would say an
army was entering a conquered city, quivering
with the rapture of triumph, lifting up the
thunder of battle, Titanic bugle-calls, and the
p&aelig;ans of victory. After each one of these
narrow breaches in the wall of granite the river
plunges into deep basins, where the foaming
waters soon sink into their former quiet flow.
The soldiers have crossed the first entrenchments,
and collect their forces before the next
assault. Soon the margins on either side begin
to hem in, the waters stir more rapidly, and
soon again the mad rush, the desperate plunge,
the wild, roaring, irresistible onslaught, and
again through the very heart of the mountain
into the next basin. Finally, after storming
the last redoubt, the river, like a lion freed from
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
the toils which imprisoned him, leaps upon the
bosom of the plain, bounding forward in solemn
flow towards the ocean. The clear tropical sun
reflects itself on its ever-moving bosom, even as
the clouds and the forests, the mountains and
the birds on wing. The wandering mirror
keeps on its course, being, as Longfellow has
it, like unto the life of a good man &lsquo;darkened
by shadows of earth, but reflecting an image of
heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>We spent ten days in covering the distance
from the upper to beyond the lower rapids,
walking whenever it was impossible to use the
canoes, which were drifted by the current or
shot over the rapids. The delay was due
chiefly to the loading and unloading of the
canoes, and the necessarily slow transportation
of packages, bundles, and sundry articles along
the shore.</p>
<p>The banks of the river on either side along
the whole length of the rapids are high and
rocky, sometimes extending for a mile or two
in flat, grass-covered, wavy meadows, and then
rising in small hills, abrupt and ragged on the
very edge of the water. This is specially the
case in the narrow part of the gorges. The
grass in the small meadow-like plains is the
same as on the shores of the Meta, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
whole aspect of the region, bare of large forests,
is that of a field in a civilized country.</p>
<p>A few days after leaving Maipures we
noticed, to our joy, the absence of mosquitoes
and other such tormentors. They seemed to
have been blown away by the wind, which had
freer scope in the more open stretches along
the main river.</p>
<p>We missed the soft couch of the sand
beaches to which we had become accustomed,
the thin layer of sand or earth being powerless
to soften the bed-rock on which we now had
to stretch ourselves, but the flight of the
mosquitoes and their companions more than
made up for this.</p>
<p>Our commissariat had dwindled to utter
meagreness; we had neither sugar nor coffee,
and <i>casabe</i> was our only bread. The last drops
of <i>aguardiente</i> had been drained at Santa
Catalina. At Maipures we had obtained a
drink which they called white rum&mdash;in truth,
pure alcohol, which we had to drown in three
times the quantity of water before we swallowed
it. Our cigars, cigarettes and tobacco were
all gone; they were part and parcel of an
enchanted past&mdash;smoke wafted heavenward
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
like so many of our hopes and illusions. We
had obtained native tobacco, with which we
made cigars or rolled cigarettes out of newspaper
clippings. Thus we consumed many
a literary article or political effusion which it
would have been utterly impossible to utilize
in any other way. Corn-cob pipes also came
in handily.</p>
<p>Game, furred or feathered, was not to be
found on the shores of the rapids; we had to
rely principally on fishing, which was most
abundant in the quieter pools and basins. We
ate all sorts of fish, some of admirable quality,
especially the <i>morrocoto</i>, far superior to the
French sole or the American shad, blue fish,
or Spanish mackerel. If Marguery could meet
with it, his immense renown would increase
tenfold, as with this fish at his disposal he
would be certain to evolve what from a
culinary point of view would amount to an
epic poem of the most sublime order. Such,
at least, was my opinion when eating that
fish, with my imagination duly fired by a
voracious appetite and a lack of material condiments
which gave rise to dreams worthy of
Lucullus in exile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Rice and salt we had in plenty; butter, oil,
and lard were unknown quantities. Had we
been in Lent, necessity would have enabled us
very easily to observe the ordinance of the
Roman Church with regard to abstinence from
meat. We thought of this, and although we
were not sure of our dates, we at once decided
to offer up our enforced diet in a truly Catholic
spirit in atonement for some of our many sins!
May our offering prove acceptable!</p>
<p>We did not go to sleep as readily on our
new hard beds as on the sand. The clearness
of the air and freedom from insects also contributed
to long watches, which we spent in
listening to the far-off roar of the river pealing
incessantly through the night air, whilst Gati&ntilde;o
would tell us about the life of men and beasts
in those territories. The voice of the river
seemed like the distant bass of a powerful
orchestra, all the high notes of which had been
lost in space.</p>
<p>Gati&ntilde;o was familiar with the rivers that flow
into the Orinoco above its confluence with the
Vichada, and the numerous <i>ca&ntilde;os</i> which intersect
that region were so well known to him
that on one occasion, when flying from some
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
Governor on his way to the upper territories
who was anxious to obtain his services as a
guide, Gati&ntilde;o had managed to lose himself in
such an intricate maze of <i>ca&ntilde;os</i> and water-ways,
and, finally, in a small lagoon, unknown to all
except the wild Indians, that the Governor
had given up the chase in despair. He
had travelled on the Casiquiare and the Rio
Negro, and had visited the Upper Amazon.
According to him, the Upper Orinoco and its
affluents are as abundant in india-rubber forests
as the Amazon and its tributaries, the Putumayo,
the Napo and the Yarabi. The gum or
india-rubber is identical in quality with that of
the best species of Para. In some places the
trees grow so closely that a man may extract
from twenty to forty pounds of india-rubber a
day. Besides large virgin areas rich in india-rubber
forests, in other parts <i>piazaba</i> palm
forests stretch for hundreds of acres at a time.
This <i>piazaba</i> is used for matting, broom-making,
and twisting of ropes and cables. It is perfectly
impervious to moisture, and is even said
to improve instead of rotting in water. Not
far from where we were in one of the <i>ca&ntilde;os</i>,
the <i>piazaba</i> forest followed the water-course for
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
a distance of, Gati&ntilde;o said, &lsquo;twenty twists.&rsquo; An
odd system of measuring, but the only one at
his command. &lsquo;Twenty twists&rsquo; might be five
or twenty miles, according to the size of the
curves. These forests further contained infinite
abundance of sarsaparilla, tonga bean, <i>peraman</i>
and <i>cara&ntilde;a</i>, the resinous substances used for
caulking and torch-making. Gati&ntilde;o himself
exploited those sources of wealth as far as
his own personal means and limitations would
allow him. He stated his willingness at any
time to guide us to the spots where rubber,
tonga bean, and so forth, could be found,
adding that he knew we would treat him
well, but that he would never consent to act
as a guide to others, especially to the white
men in official positions who now and then
appeared along the river. These he held in
special abhorrence, and no doubt their doings
justified his feelings.</p>
<p>Gati&ntilde;o&rsquo;s statements as to the wealth of the
Orinoco were perfectly truthful. It seems
strange that such vast sources of wealth
should remain practically unexploited. The
rapids of the Orinoco act as a barrier, before
which traders and explorers have come to a
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
standstill. Some sixty or seventy years ago
cart-roads existed on the shores along the
rapids; these were built by the missionaries,
and parts of them are still intact. Vegetation
being weak on the hard soil of those banks, it
would be easy to re-establish them. The
great obstacle, however, is to be found in
the numerous affluents which fall into the
Orinoco along the rapids. The missionaries
had large pontoon-like rafts on which they
transported their carts from one side to the
other. Were this primitive service started
once more, the flow of natural products extracted
from the forests would soon establish
itself from the Upper to the Lower Orinoco.</p>
<p>One day, having left our canoes behind, we
arrived at the shores of the Cantaniapo, a clear
stream flowing into the Orinoco between two
stretches of rapids. No tree shaded us from
the fierce glare of the sun. The waters
murmured most invitingly on the pebbles of
the beach. On the other side was a sort of
shed, a vestige of former splendour. A small
canoe was moored alongside, tied with a <i>piazaba</i>
rope to the trunk of a neighbouring tree. So
near, and yet so far! We should have to wait,
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
perhaps, broiling in the sun for hours, till our
canoes arrived. Whilst we discussed the
arduous architectural problem of building a
tent with such articles as coats, india-rubber
waterproof sheets, and so on, a noise as of a
body falling into the water drew our attention
to the river. Leal, holding his <i>machete</i> between
his teeth, was swimming <i>llanero</i> fashion&mdash;that
is to say, throwing each arm out of the water
in succession, and covering a distance equal to
the length of his body at every stroke. The
peril, potentially speaking, was extreme; one
never knows whether the alligators and other
inhabitants of those waters may or may not be
at hand. Yet Leal did not seem to care.
Fortunately, he soon landed on the opposite
shore, jumped into the canoe, cut the rope
and paddled back. On our remonstrating with
him, he argued that the danger was slight;
alligators hate noise, and he had taken care to
be as noisy as possible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Furthermore,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;I had my <i>machete</i>
with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We stopped that night under the shed.
Gati&ntilde;o came in due time. We particularly
wished to bathe in the transparent waters of
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
that river, not as Leal had done, but in our
usual prudent way, standing on the shore far
from all possible danger.</p>
<p>The next morning we saw the only living
tiger which met our eyes during that long trip.
Early, before striking the camp, the shout went
forth&mdash;&lsquo;A tiger! A tiger!&rsquo; There, at a distance
of about 150 feet from us, on a small
protruding ledge which plunged into the river,
forming a sort of natural drinking-place, stood
a beautiful specimen of the native tiger. The
wind, which, as Leal told us, blew from the
land, carried the scent in the wrong direction,
and this explained the tiger&rsquo;s visit. On hearing
the shout, Leal sprang up and seized one
of the rifles. The tiger looked towards our
group and turned tail, bolting in the direction
whence he had come, behind a clump of bushes.
Leal followed him. We soon heard a shot, and
after a few minutes Leal returned, disgusted.
He had only wounded the animal. I argued
with him that we were most thankful to the
lord of the forest for his abrupt courtesy in
leaving the field entirely to us, as, had he felt
inclined to enter into closer relations, we might
have found it awkward, to say the least.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>Valiente had come with Gati&ntilde;o. Our belongings
seemed to him, as they had previously
seemed to Leal, an abnormal accumulation of
wealth. We had kept with us, not knowing
whether they might again be required, our
riding-saddles. My own was large, comfortable,
and soft, a work of art in its way. Valiente
seemed to admire it. The remarks which he
made deserve to be noted here.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This saddle is certainly very fine and comfortable;
but how do you manage when crossing
a river? Do you not find it very heavy on
your head?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I could not understand what he meant, until
I remembered that the <i>llaneros</i>, when swimming
across a river, generally carry their saddles on
their heads to keep them dry. At first I thought
Valiente was &lsquo;pulling my leg.&rsquo; A mere glance
at my person should suffice to persuade anyone
that not even the furious onslaught of a regiment
of Cossacks would induce me in any
circumstances to plunge into a river where
there was a chance of meeting alligators and
such-like; I was still less likely to venture on
such feats with the additional burden of a heavy
saddle on my head. However, Valiente was
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
perfectly in earnest, and meant no harm; so
I assured him with perfect calm that I had
never noticed on any occasion, either in or
out of the water, that the saddle was a heavy
one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Possibly,&rsquo; I added, &lsquo;it is a question of habit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May be,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but it would be a long
time before I got used to it. Look at my
saddle!&rsquo; he went on to say; &lsquo;it only weighs
a fourth of yours. Still, I should like to try
yours, not for real hard work&mdash;branding, lassoing,
or rounding up cattle&mdash;but just to prance
round the town on a good horse and charm the
girls. That&rsquo;s about what it&rsquo;s fit for!&rsquo;</p>
<p>That day, marked in the calendar of our
memory as the &lsquo;tiger day,&rsquo; our supper consisted
of boiled rice and <i>casabe</i>. Somehow or
other there had been no fishing. Yet we did
not grumble; custom had taught us to be easily
satisfied. We learned from Gati&ntilde;o that within
twelve miles from us the Atures ruins were
to be found. Behind the thick forest which
separates it from the river stands a short range
of high cliffs. They are the last spur of the
chain through which the Orinoco has drilled its
way. At a height of 600 to 700 metres on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
vertical wall, so straight and smooth that it
seems to have been polished all over by the
hand of man, there appear, carved in the very
substance of the rock, a huge alligator and
two human figures, standing near its head and
tail respectively. All are of colossal dimensions.
According to the measurements of other
travellers provided with the required instruments,
the length of the alligator exceeds
500 feet, and the human figures are of proportionate
size. It is difficult to understand
what sort of scaffolding was used to carry out
this work at such a height, no support or
traces of support of any kind in the rock being
apparent; what instruments were used for the
carving, and what purpose the whole work
served: all this is very perplexing.</p>
<p>Footprints of human endeavour, thoughts of
past generations entirely lost to our minds, left
there in the midst of the forest, marking the
passage of men who must have been powerful
at a period so remote that only these traces
remain. What more eloquent proof of the
nothingness, the vanity, of our own ephemeral
individual life!</p>
<p>The mere magnitude of the work carried out
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
demonstrates that in those regions, totally
deserted to-day, where Nature has reasserted
her absolute sway, and where the wanderer has
to fight for every inch of ground in the jungle
and the thicket, there must once have been
multitudes of men educated in certain arts&mdash;arts
which in their turn must have been links
in a chain of sequence indispensable to their
own existence, as isolated effort in one direction
would be incomprehensible. Nothing of those
myriads of men survives beyond this dumb
expression of their thoughts and aspirations.</p>
<p>Were those figures carved on that huge wall,
on the virgin rock of the mountains, hundreds
or thousands of years ago? Who knows?
Who can tell?</p>
<p>With the rapidity inherent to human thought,
my mind sped to the pyramids of Egypt, the
ruins of Babylon and Nineveh, the buried cities
of Ceylon, the excavated temples and palaces
in Yucatan and elsewhere, wherever vestiges
of vanished generations are found.</p>
<p>That sculpture on the rock on the shores of
the Orinoco brought to my mind the dying lion
cut into the granite on the banks of the Lake
of Lucerne, as a symbol of respect and admiration
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
to the loyalty and steadfastness of the
compatriots of William Tell, who died for a
cause upon which judgment has been passed
in the minds of men and in the pages of history.
I could not help thinking that perhaps when
Macaulay&rsquo;s famous New Zealander shall stand
upon the broken arches of London Bridge to
gaze at the ruins of St. Paul&rsquo;s, when England and
London shall have crumbled into potsherds, so
in years to come some native of these Orinoco
regions, then populous and civilized, may sail
on the cool waters of Lucerne and interrogate
the mute rock, anxious to know the allegory
embodied in that dying lion holding in its
claws the shield which bears the three secular
lilies of old France. Even as the rock was
mute to us, so shall the rock again be mute to
him who thousands of years hence may question
Thorwaldsen&rsquo;s sculpture. The efforts of
man are powerless against time and oblivion,
even though they choose the largest, the most
lasting manifestations of Nature for their
pedestal.</p>
<p>Time passes grimly on. The endeavours of
pride, of flattery, of gratitude, the emblems
of glory, all become dumb and meaningless.
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
Egyptian hieroglyphics, figures and signs
carved in monoliths or pyramids or in the rock
of the mountains, after the lapse of what, to the
world, is but an instant, all become confused,
vague, and undefinable. The seeker and the
student find all those attempts to perpetuate the
memory or the aspirations of men, now on the
burning sands of the desert, now decked in the
foliage and wealth of Nature, aggressively reasserting
her empire, now in the naked summits
of the uplifted mountains&mdash;yea, the seeker finds
them all; but he knows not whether they be
expressions of human pride anxious to survive
the life of the body, or whether they be witnesses
of servile flattery paying tribute to the mighty, or
the grateful offering of nations to their heroes
and their benefactors, or the emblem of some
dim forgotten religion, whose very rites are as
unintelligible to living men as is the mystic
power which once gave them force.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p>With the accession of Gati&ntilde;o and his family
and Valiente and his men, our numbers had
gradually increased, and the camp at night had
quite a lively aspect. The men would tell their
adventures, and conversation frequently turned
on local topics. We had gradually drifted into
practical indifference concerning the doings of
that distant world to which we belonged, and
towards which we were moving. Newspapers,
letters, telegrams, the multifarious scraps of
gossip, the bursts of curiosity which fill so
great a part in the life of modern man, had
totally disappeared as daily elements in our
own. To tell the truth, I did not miss
them greatly. I have always thought that the
daily newspapers are thieves of time, and cannot
but approve the system of a certain friend
of mine, an Englishman, who, residing in New
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
York, had no other source of information for
the world&rsquo;s news than the weekly edition of
the <i>Times</i>. He was dependent on it even for
the news of American life and politics.</p>
<p>He argued that the ups and downs of a given
event were of little interest to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All that one need know,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is the
upshot, the crystallized fact, without wasting
valuable time in the slow developments which,
at times, are pure inventions of the editor&mdash;&ldquo;padding,&rdquo;
as it is called. I am a little behind-hand
at times,&rsquo; he remarked, &lsquo;but at the end of
the year I make it up, balance the account, and
start afresh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Certainly if all the attention given to local
news of no importance, or to descriptions of fires,
crimes, and sundry topics which never change
in essence and vary solely as regards names
and secondary details, were devoted to studying
something useful, the average mind of the great
newspaper-reading nations would not have been
degraded to the depths revealed by a glance at a
collection of the newspapers and reading matter
on the bookstalls of any railway-station in
France, England, or the United States, where
the flood of trash and sensationalism swamps
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
and carries away with it public intelligence, or
what stands for it.</p>
<p>Gautier used to complain of the curse of the
daily press.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Formerly,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;every human being
brayed in his own original asinine way. Now
we only get variations on the leaders in their
respective newspapers!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The great French writer expressed the simple
truth in a pointed way. The cheap press, like
cheap liquor, is a public calamity.</p>
<p>Our men poured forth personal impressions of
Nature. The world varies in size and in beauty
in proportion to the eye and the mind that contemplate
it. In Leal&rsquo;s and Valiente&rsquo;s conversation
especially there was something like the
voice of the forest and the murmuring waters.
They had lived to some purpose in those
deserts, and to them cities, railways, palaces,
sea-going ships, and all the other methods of
modern locomotion&mdash;material civilization, in
fact&mdash;were as wonderful as the beauties and
splendours of Eastern tales are to us.</p>
<p>Talking about tigers, Leal told us that they
roamed all over those plains, especially on the
banks of the Meta and the Orinoco, where the
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
forests intersect breeding and grazing plains.
The cattle-ranchers must be ever on the watch,
and from instinct and experience the cattle
acquire a natural spirit of defence without which
the losses would be far heavier than at present.</p>
<p>Whenever the cattle scent the approach of
the tiger, they crowd together, the young calves
in the centre, the cows and young heifers covering
them behind their bodies, and the bulls
pacing around and outside the group like
sentinels before a tent. There is no exaggeration
in this tale. Leal assured us that he had
himself seen these preparations on more than
one occasion.</p>
<p>The tiger, whose daring and ferocity are
multiplied tenfold by hunger, frequently attacks
the group: then ensues a life and death struggle.
The tiger tries to jump upon the bull sideways
or from behind, whilst the bull strives to face the
tiger constantly. As the latter is far more agile
and can leap from a long distance, he frequently
lands upon the bull, sometimes breaking his
spine with the blow. If he misses, the bull
gores him. Occasionally both animals die, the
tiger in its death-struggle tearing the bull&rsquo;s
neck open with its claws.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&lsquo;More than once,&rsquo; said Leal, &lsquo;have I found
the two enemies dead in a pool of blood side
by side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The tigers also crouch in the bushes close to
the drinking-places, and jump upon the animals
as they lower their heads into the water. They
rip open the necks of their victims, drag them
into the jungle, and there devour them.</p>
<p>The hunters know that a sated tiger is far
less daring than a hungry one, and they
frequently place a calf or some other easy prey
within his reach. After his meal he is hunted
down, but Leal added that this is not considered
fair play amongst thoroughbred <i>llaneros</i>; it is a
trick unworthy of a real sportsman.</p>
<p>The tigers live exclusively upon other animals.
They prefer cattle, and have a special predilection
for donkeys and mules; they are
gourmets. The choicest morsel to their taste
seems to be the fat neck of donkeys and mules;
they have, too, a pretty taste in turtles. They
can crush the back of the younger turtles not
yet fully developed. These awkward amphibians
rush, if their ponderous movements can
be so described, into the water for fear of the
tiger. There he is powerless to harm them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>The alligator rivals the tiger in voracity and
fierceness. They are sworn enemies, and
attack each other whenever they meet. The
odds are on the tiger&rsquo;s side if the struggle be on
land, and in favour of the alligator if the pair
meet in the water. The tiger seeks to turn the
alligator over on his back, or to get at the body
towards the stomach, where the softer skin can
be penetrated by the tiger&rsquo;s claws, which
disembowel his enemy. The alligator defends
himself by striking terrific blows with his tail,
and seeks to scrunch the tiger between his
formidable jaws. Fights between them, Leal
said, are frequently seen on the beaches, and
are a fascinating though ghastly spectacle.</p>
<p>The tigers frequently cross rivers infested
with alligators, and display a really marvellous
cunning in avoiding their enemy in his own
element. The tiger will stand on the beach at
a given point of the river, and there roar with
all his might for an hour or so on end.
The alligators, in the hope of getting at him,
congregate in the water at that particular point.
When the members of the assembly thus
convened have, so far as the tiger can judge,
met at the appointed place, he starts up-stream
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
along the banks as rapidly as possible, and
crosses two or three miles higher up. There
are two details to be noted: first, the stratagem
by which the tiger misleads his enemies; and,
second, his choice of a crossing-place, so that the
alligator would have to swim against the current
to get at him.</p>
<p>Both Leal and Valiente had the true cattle-breeder&rsquo;s
love for cattle, which to them are
man&rsquo;s best friends.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They give us milk and meat and cheese,&rsquo;
Leal would say; &lsquo;they help us to cultivate the
ground, and their very presence drives away
fevers, mosquitoes, and miasmas. We and the
cattle are allies against the boas, the tigers, the
snakes, and all the beasts without which these
lands would be a real paradise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The tales of our friends sounded most
wonderful in Fermin&rsquo;s ears. He was a townsman,
accustomed to bricks and mortar; furthermore,
he was naturally sceptical as to all that
he heard, and felt rather small at seeing our
men&rsquo;s familiarity with things and manifestations
of Nature which to him were so strange
and new.</p>
<p>Fermin came from the city of Medellin, where
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
he had spent most of his life. It is a typical
old Spanish town of the central tropical belt.
It nestles amongst the hills, 100 miles from
the left bank of the Magdalena River, at a
height of about 4,500 feet. The ground around
is mountainous. The valley is small and
beautiful, with numberless streams coursing
down the hills, and luxuriant vegetation in
perpetual bloom.</p>
<p>Prior to this journey, Fermin&rsquo;s travels had
never taken him beyond his own province.
Like all Colombians, he had been a soldier at
some period of his life, a &lsquo;volunteer&rsquo; of the type
described in a telegram (very well known in
Colombia) which a candid or witty&mdash;the distinction
is at times difficult&mdash;mayor sent to a
colleague in a neighbouring town: &lsquo;Herewith
I send a hundred volunteers; kindly return the
ropes!&rsquo; Having joined the army in this wise,
it is not strange that Fermin left it as soon as
he could. His military career was no longer
and no more glorious than Coleridge&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Continental Europeans are wont to grow
amusingly solemn and censorious when they
hear of the system still obtaining in many parts
of Spanish America for the formation of armies
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
which are chiefly engaged in the civil wars that
devastate those countries from time to time;
this system is nothing more nor less than the
press-gang method practised all over Europe
not so long ago. But between this press-gang,
which suddenly compels a man to join the ranks
destined to fight, and the conscription, which
forces him into the army whether he likes it or
not, I can only see a difference of detail, but
none in essence. Individual liberty is as much
violated in the one case as in the other. In
both cases the weak, the helpless, and the
poor are the prey of the more cunning and more
powerful, and as for the causes at stake, whatever
the name or pretext may be, if the whole
question is sifted, greed and ambition masquerading
under some conventional high-sounding
name will be found to be the real and
essential motors. Militarism is a form of
exploitation of mankind which adds human
blood to the ingredients productive of gold and
power to others; it is nothing but an engine of
plunder and of pride, the more disgusting on
account of its sleek hypocrisy. Your money-lender
frankly tells you that he will charge you
three, four, or five per cent. per month, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
despoil you of house and home if you cannot
pay; this, though cruel, is frank and open and
above-board. But your advocate of militarism
will despoil you like the cosmopolite Jew,
telling you that glory shall be yours, that
patriotism and the holy traditions of religion,
the dynasty, the empire, or the nation, as the
case may be, are at stake, and that it is necessary
for you to risk your skin in consequence. With
such baubles and clownish maunderings men
have been led on, and are still being led on, to
cut each other&rsquo;s throats for the personal benefit
and satisfaction of their leaders, who give them
a bit of ribbon or stamped metal if they survive
and have luck. Meanwhile the exploiters sit
safe on their office chairs, pocket the shekels,
and chuckle at the pack of fools, the smug
middle-class flunkies, and the dirty, bamboozled
millions, the cannon fodder, fit only for bayonet
and shrapnel.</p>
<p>After leaving the army, Fermin, who by
trade was a journeyman tailor, had joined the
remnants of a wrecked theatrical company, a
group of strollers travelling through the towns
and villages of his province, and giving performances
from the modern and the ancient
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
Spanish repertory, to the enjoyment and the
edification of the natives.</p>
<p>He had been in my service for over a year,
proving himself admirable as a valet, and
certainly very plastic, for during the journey he
had been by turns muleteer, amateur paddler,
fisherman, hunter and cook.</p>
<p>The people of his province, a hardy mountaineer
race, so prolific that population doubles
itself every twenty-eight years, are known all
over Spanish America for their readiness at
repartee, the frequent metaphors that brighten
their daily speech, and a knack of humorous
exaggeration.</p>
<p>Fermin, referring to one of the men whose
idleness he criticised, said, &lsquo;That fellow is so
lazy that he cannot even carry a greeting!&rsquo; and
talking of the wonderful climbing ability of
a certain mule, he said that, if it could only find
the way, it would reach the gates of heaven and
bray in the ears of St. Peter!</p>
<p>One evening, during a lull in the conversation,
Fermin, who had quietly listened to tales
of fierce tigers, chivalrous bulls, alligators, and
many other natives of forest or stream, burst
forth, saying that he also knew of some wonderful
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
beasts; but I prefer to quote his words as nearly
as possible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The truth is,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that before starting
on this trip I knew nothing about tigers, alligators,
boas, and so forth, except from picture-books.
I had even thought that people lied a
great deal about those animals, but sight has
now convinced me of their existence. I have
no doubt they are to be found somewhere in my
native province, but it is not about them that
I am going to talk. I will tell you something
which will show that we, too, have wonderful
animals in our part of the country.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some years ago I was the first lover in
a theatrical company which, though modest in
its pretensions, scored great success wherever
it played. One night, in the mining region near
the Cauca River, we were forced to sleep in the
very shed where we had performed the comic
opera entitled &ldquo;The Children of Captain Grant,&rdquo;
a most popular seafaring tale set to music.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mosquitoes were as abundant and aggressive
as anywhere in the world, but they seemed to
me to have far stronger lungs than those of
these localities. Anyhow, there was a specially
sustained high-sounding ring in their little
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
trumpets, so that they formed a sort of orchestra
beneath the moon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One of the lady artistes held the doctrine
that life was sacred in all its manifestations;
that man has no right to kill any animal, however
small it may be, so she did not kill the
mosquitoes that swarmed around her, but tried
to blow them away with her fan. However,
as some of them alighted on her forehead and
on her hands, she would take them carefully
between thumb and forefinger and place them
on the side of a basin half filled with water,
moistening their wings so that they stuck and
remained harmless for the time being.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The smokers amongst us&mdash;all the men, in
fact&mdash;after lighting their cigars or cigarettes,
threw their wooden matches into the basin,
a necessary precaution lest the thatch-roofed
shed might catch fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the earlier part of the night the mosquitoes
made sleep almost impossible, and there
we lay on the ground or upon canvas stretchers
snoozing and tossing about, waiting for the morning.
As night advanced, with the arrival of a
welcome breeze, they seemed to diminish in
numbers. I began to doze, but was awakened
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
by one of my companions who called my attention
to the echo of distant music, sweet and
low, a harmony of lutes and soft recorders,
whose sounds were wafted on the wings of
the night air. We went out of the shed, and
the sounds ceased. On returning to it we
heard the melody again. This was a mystery.
Nearly all our companions were asleep. We
were determined to ascertain whence the music
came, and, on investigation, found that the
blessed mosquitoes, placed by the charitable
and humane artiste on the sides of the basin,
had contrived to build a raft with the fag-ends
of matches, on which, waiting for their wings
to dry completely, they were whiling the night
away gaily singing the most popular ditty in
our operetta, descriptive of the joys of life on
the ocean wave!</p>
<p>&lsquo;This will show you,&rsquo; Fermin added, &lsquo;that,
though we have neither tigers, nor boas, nor
turtles, nor fighting bulls, nor alligators, in our
province, our mosquitoes beat all yours in talent
and ability!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p>Not far from the Atures rapids, we stopped at
Puerto Real, a short curve in the river where
the waters penetrate into a sort of bay justifying
the name of &lsquo;port,&rsquo; but with no other title to
it, for no human habitation, not even the
humblest hut, exists on either shore. Here
the canoes were laden permanently, as the river
flowed straight to the ocean, free from all rapids
except at a few narrow places where the current
is swifter. These, however, did not call for the
precautions of the past days.</p>
<p>Leal considered his task at an end. We
were on the open Orinoco in the Republic
of Venezuela, and in the hands of a guide as
careful and expert as Gati&ntilde;o. This led Leal
to return. In vain did we seek to persuade
him to accompany us, to enter Colombia by the
Magdalena River, thence to Bogot&aacute;, and then
by the road we had followed to San Pedro del
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
Tua. He would not abandon his companions,
and decided to go back by the identical route
we had followed. We deeply felt parting from
that noble companion whose quiet, unobtrusive
courage, whose skilled prudence and ready
intelligence, had not only contributed greatly
to our comfort during the ninety odd days that
he had been with us, but had doubtless saved
our lives on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>As a proof of the extent and value of his
services, I will quote a letter received many
months after in Europe, when, in the midst of
modern civilization, the events and occurrences
of my journey through the tropical regions of
South America seemed more like a dream than
a reality. Alex, who had returned to Bogot&aacute;,
wrote as follows:</p>
<p class="tb">&lsquo;I have just received a letter from Leal,
dated from his home at San Pedro del Tua.
You will remember that he left us with fourteen
of our men, to return by the Vichada and the
Meta. On the very day of their departure,
whilst they were ascending the rapids, and we
proceeded on our journey down-stream, only
a few hours after bidding us farewell, one of
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
the two canoes, carrying seven men, struck the
trunk of a tree lying under the water, and
capsized. The men were all good swimmers,
and soon overtook the canoe, which was drifting
with the stream. After a good deal of trouble,
they succeeded in turning it over. Whilst they
were getting back into it, they were attacked
by two enormous alligators which sought to
overturn the canoe, striking it furiously with
their tails. One of the sailors was struck on
the head and stunned, losing his grip, and
before he could be pulled in the other alligator
cut his body in two, as if with a saw, crushing
him between its jaws, so that the man was
actually devoured in the very presence of his
companions.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="tb">On reading these tragic details, I felt a cold
shiver run through me, like a man who sees
lightning strike an object close to him, or feels
a murderous bullet whizz past his head. A
retrospective fear seized upon me at the thought
of the many nights spent on the lonely beaches,
and the numberless times that our canoes had
struck submerged rocks or trunks of trees.
Surely a kind Providence had watched over us
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
during that long journey. &lsquo;The child&rsquo;s heart
within the man&rsquo;s&rsquo; revived in me, with the faith
in God learnt from the lips of my mother, and
my soul went to her who, during those long,
anxious days, had prayed night and day to Him
above for the safety of her absent son.</p>
<p>Greatly diminished in numbers, we continued
downwards, hoping to strike some camp of
tonga-bean-gatherers, the harvest season
having just begun.</p>
<p>If the Meta had seemed large and mighty
to us, the Orinoco bore the aspect of an inland
sea. The breezes and the hurricanes blow
upon its billows and dash them into surf on
the bank; the trade-winds&mdash;our old friends of
the Meta&mdash;reappeared on the Orinoco, only
far stronger than before. One would say that
they spend their force in the long journey, and
are somewhat weary in the upper regions. It
is impossible to make any progress in the
teeth of the trade-wind. With a stern or a
side wind the canoes hoist their sails and
travel with the speed of birds on the wing.
The great force of the wind is generally felt
during the middle hours of the day; it lulls in
the morning and afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>Far more frequently than on the Meta we
were forced to wait for hours on the sandy
desert beaches, or close in to the shore covered
with jungle, waiting, waiting for the wind to
sink. The worst feature of these breezes is
that they raise a great quantity of sand to a
height varying from 2 to 3 feet.</p>
<p>Cooking becomes impossible, as the wind
blows the fire out, scattering the embers
and the logs, and unless rocks or trees be
available on which to sit at a certain height,
one is compelled to stand, as it is impossible
to breathe the air, which is impregnated with
sand. At such times we were compelled to
make our meals of <i>casabe</i> dipped in water, and
drink more freely of the white rum which took
the place of warmer food and drink. Once we
were kept thus imprisoned for nearly thirty
hours; our helplessness against the elements
exercised a most depressing influence.</p>
<p>The tonga bean, called in Spanish <i>zarrapia</i>,
constitutes a most important article of trade, and
is obtained in large quantities on the shore of the
Orinoco and of many of its affluents below the
rapids. It is said to abound also in the Upper
Orinoco, but there it is seldom gathered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>The tonga-tree is large and leafy, very
similar to the mango-tree. The branches,
which spread over an area of 20, 30, or 40 feet,
are covered with thick foliage, and the yield
of fruit is enormous. The fruit resembles the
mango in shape and appearance. Under a
sweet pulp, quite palatable, is found an oval
nut, identical with that of the mango, and
inside this nut, which has the consistency of
a walnut, is encased a small elongated bean of
a pink colour. It soon turns dark red when
exposed to air and sun. The trees shed the
fruit in the months of February and March;
the men gather it from the ground, clean off
the pulp, and break the nut with stones. This
must be carefully done to avoid breaking the
bean, which is then placed in the sun on dry,
untanned hides, and after two or three days
packed in bags ready for transportation.</p>
<p>The tonga bean is chiefly used in perfumery,
and is a very good substitute for vanilla.</p>
<p>We were told that the exports averaged, at the
prices then ranging, a yearly output of &pound;100,000
to &pound;150,000.	I understand that the price
has fallen considerably of late years, but as
the gathering costs very little, and the transportation,
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
owing to the numerous waterways, is
cheap, there must still be great profits in the
business.</p>
<p>Traders flock from the different parts of the
river to certain well-known camps, from which
they branch off into the forests, bringing back
the bean for sale to the camps. Although the
Venezuelan Government has more than once
granted special privileges and monopolies to
individuals and companies for the exploitation
of the tonga bean, its gathering is practically
free, as it would be next to impossible to watch
over such vast uninhabited areas where men
can easily conceal themselves in the forests.</p>
<p>Our progress was far slower than before, as
we generally lost half a day waiting for the
breeze to fall. This was owing principally to
the size of our canoes, too small for navigation
in a high wind.</p>
<p>In due time we came upon the first camp, a
most welcome sight to our eyes; a whole village
of tents stood pitched on the bank of the river,
and upwards of twenty or thirty canoes were
moored along the shore. Amongst them we
saw a small one-masted schooner, which raised
its graceful lines above the surrounding small
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
craft. We gazed upon it with covetous eyes,
and decided to make every possible effort to
acquire it, if it could be had for love or money.</p>
<p>We did not attract any attention at first;
the people in the camp thought that we were
tonga-bean-gatherers like themselves, coming
from some point above; but they showed great
interest and courtesy on hearing that we came
not only from beyond the rapids, but from the
upper affluents of the Orinoco. We soon
closed a bargain for the schooner, into which
we transferred our belongings, and the next day
the three small sails were let loose to the very
breeze that, during the past few days, had
nailed us to the shores.</p>
<p>Besides the schooner, we obtained a supply
of provisions, though not as much as we
wished. The traders had only what they
needed, and were loath to part with them,
especially as we were going towards the centres
of supply.</p>
<p>In the course of a day or two we stopped at
a large flat island, some twelve miles in length,
as we were told, and varying from two to four
miles in breadth; this is known as the Beach of
Lard (<i>Playa de la Manteca</i>). This island is
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
the laying-place of hundreds of thousands of
turtles, which come to it every year in the laying
season. The island belongs to the Government,
who place a small detachment of soldiers
to watch over it. The traders buy the right of
working a given section of the ground. They
dig out the eggs, from which the oil is extracted.
It is used for cooking, and is a substitute for
lard and butter&mdash;hence the name of the beach.</p>
<p>The turtles swarm in myriads, and are forced
by those coming up behind them to go further
into the island. After laying their eggs they
seek the water, but are so numerous that it
is necessary for the soldiers and traders to keep
a pathway open, otherwise many of them could
not get back to the river.</p>
<p>It is a marvel to see countless acres of ground
covered with turtles as thick as the stones of a
pavement; and the fact might be incredible if
it were not vouched for by so many travellers.</p>
<p>A turtle lays, according to its size and age,
from fifty to three or four hundred eggs. The
men&mdash;traders or Government agents&mdash;are free
to take as many turtles as they like; the eggs
are the only article of barter upon which a price
is set.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>Some idea of the number of turtles laying
eggs on the beach may be gathered from the
reckoning of a French traveller who investigated
the subject.</p>
<p>The oil extracted from the eggs is gathered
in demijohns holding on an average seven gallons
each, and the average yield of a good year is
about ten thousand demijohns. Each demijohn
requires from four to five thousand eggs; ten
thousand demijohns represent from four to five
millions, which means that there must be from
four to five hundred thousand turtles. The tale
seems extravagant.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that we took in as large
a supply of turtles and of eggs as we could
carry. The sailors of the schooner were delighted
at the prospect of turtle meat and turtle eggs
<i>ad libitum</i>. The eggs are boiled in salt water,
and keep for a practically indefinite period.</p>
<p>The capacity for eating these eggs shown by
the natives of those regions seems to be unlimited.
I could not understand, looking at the
size of the men and at the young mountain of
turtle eggs before which they sat, and which
disappeared after a period of sustained assimilation,
how it was possible that they did not
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
swell outwardly or explode. Here was a case
in which the envelope was, to all purposes and
appearances, smaller than the contents assimilated&mdash;a
problem for some sapient naturalist to
investigate whenever he may chance to stray
into those remote regions.</p>
<p>It is said that the turtle yields seven kinds
of meat, and that in the hands of a good cook
it is transfigured into calf&rsquo;s head, veal, tender
loin steak, chicken, venison, pork, and (naturally)
turtle meat. Be that as it may, notwithstanding
the uncouth and, to some, repulsive appearance
of the animal, it is evident that the various parts
of its body are not only palatable, but may be
disguised to imitate the varieties mentioned, a
peculiarity which in its turn works inversely, as
in the well-known case of mock-turtle soup.</p>
<p>The turtles we bought were placed on their
backs, which seems to be the universal method
of keeping them all the world over. There in
the bottom of our schooner the poor beasts had
ample opportunity to watch the flight of clouds
by day and the grouping of the constellations by
night. I fear, however, that they did not improve
their time with the study either of atmospherical
changes or of astronomical wonders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>Fermin rapidly learnt how to cook and prepare
turtles in the various native ways, to which he
added devices of his own, reminiscent of the
preparation of other meats and dishes in his
native province.</p>
<p>The change of diet was most welcome at
first, but after the fourth or fifth day the very
name of turtle was revolting. Fermin was told
that, if nothing else but turtle was to be found,
we preferred to fall back on boiled rice and
<i>casabe</i>. Relying, however, on his ability and
the protean plasticity of turtle meat, he insisted
on serving some of it as wild-boar flesh, and
only upon a formal threat of shooting, or being
left tied to the trunk of a tree along the shore,
like a new Andromache, did he cease his attempts
to deceive our palates. Thus, notwithstanding
the plentiful supply of turtles and turtle eggs,
we drifted back to the diet of <i>casabe</i>, boiled
fish and boiled rice.</p>
<p>We had hoped to strike some cattle-farm,
but we scanned the horizon in vain. The
plains and the forests rolled before our eyes,
an interminable blank for our purposes.</p>
<p>Finally, as everything happens at last, our
expectation was gratified; near the confluence
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
of our old friend the Meta with the Orinoco,
we came upon a cattle-ranch where we obtained
corn, molasses, eggs, lard, cheese, coffee, and
the whole side of a recently slaughtered heifer.</p>
<p>I can readily understand that persons of a
delicate taste, should they happen to read these
awkwardly penned lines, must feel disgusted
at the recurrence of such vulgar and material
details. Their amazement will certainly be
great, for in all probability they will be surrounded
by all the comforts and the luxury of
civilized life. There is no harsher censor of
the misdeeds or faults arising out of somebody
else&rsquo;s hunger than the drowsy philosopher who
passes judgment in a comfortable armchair after
a plentiful meal; his untempted rectitude makes
him the austerest critic of failings and weaknesses
in others. However, the opinion of those
immaculate beings, with their hot-house virtue,
safe from wind and wet behind glass panes,
receives precisely the attention it deserves.</p>
<p>Still, I admit that, after having crossed those
regions, it were better if I could describe what
I saw in a series of pen-pictures which would
unroll before the reader in sequence or harmonious
groups the numerous sublime aspects
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
of Nature; it were far better that, even as the
essence retains the perfume of the flower, the
written word should convey to other minds
the deep impression left upon my own by the
mysterious murmuring forest, the invisible wind
whose breath so often cooled my forehead, the
constant throb of the wandering waves pent
within their narrow channels, the infinite azure
of the sky, and the numberless sounds and
rumours, now soft, now deafening, which fill
the air in that world still free from the burden
of civilization, living the life of untrodden
Nature, a link in the endless chain of existence
ravening on death, with the great drama of
being made manifest in a thousand diverse
shapes.</p>
<p>Happy were I could I seize one single note
from that vast symphony, capture it, and fix it
with my words! Vain wishes!</p>
<p>We passed from those solitudes, leaving no
more trace behind us than the clouds in the
sky, and although the impression of the greatness
and the majesty of Nature sank deeply
into my heart, so that at times my soul, returning
to the days of the past, loses itself in the
depths of the forests and the summits of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
mountains, follows the course of the rivers, or
bathes itself in the pure atmosphere of the free
and boundless plain, whenever I seek to utter
my inmost feelings, so that others may feel and
understand with me, only the faintest shadow
of my thought falls on the blank page. The
gift of seeing and of feeling, and of creating
what we have felt and seen so that others in
their turn may feel a similar impression, has
been given by the Almighty only to those few
chosen artists and men of genius who throw
upon the work which they create &lsquo;the light
that never was on land or sea.&rsquo; I must perforce
limit myself to the humble narrative of our daily
life. I have no higher ambition in writing these
pages, and I shall be fortunate if I meet with
readers who understand my motive.</p>
<p>The schooner took us down to La Urbana
(a settlement with urban pretensions); it boasts
some <i>adobe</i> houses covered with tiles, and a
small church. Here we abandoned the schooner,
and were obliged to take to a far smaller canoe&mdash;large
enough, however, for navigation on the
Orinoco&mdash;in which we proceeded to Caicara,
where we expected to meet the steamers plying
between Ciudad Bolivar and the Apure River.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p>The journey from La Urbana to Caicara passed
off without any incident. On jumping ashore
at this latter point we hoped that we were
leaving our canoes for good, and that the rest
of the journey to Ciudad Bolivar would take
place by steam.</p>
<p>The people received us very kindly, and,
though the town was far from modern or rich,
we enjoyed some comforts that we had lacked
during the long journey which lay behind us.</p>
<p>Though eight weeks had passed since the
news of the death of the Governor of San
Carlos had reached Maipures, nothing was
known about it at Caicara. This will give an
idea of the abandonment in which those vast
territories are left by those under whose political
authority they live. Grave international complications
with the neighbouring States might
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
arise from disturbances like that at San Carlos,
and yet the news had only come down by
mere chance, brought by travellers who had
no personal interest in it.</p>
<p>Finding that there was no certainty as to
the steamers likely to touch at Caicara, we
reluctantly decided to take again to the slow
and sure method of canoeing, rather than wait
for him who had not promised to come, and
thus we proceeded on our journey in the same
canoes that we had imagined we were abandoning
once for all two days before. A feeling of
discontent began to possess us. It was not that
we were dissatisfied with the kind of life, nor
that we had become over-sensitive to the privations
inherent to it, nor that we complained of
being plain squires compelled to adopt the
practices of knight-errants, such as not eating
off linen, nor sleeping on comfortable couches,
nor under roof of house or mansion; no, our
great longing arose at the thought of those far
away in the civilized world, to whom our long
silence must necessarily be a source of anxiety.
For the rest, however, the life we were leading
had become a sort of second nature, and we
found it by no means disagreeable. We ate
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
with healthy appetites, and when night came,
stretched on our matting, we heedlessly let the
wind fold its wings or shriek into madness,
whilst the river either murmured gently along
like a stream across the green meadow or
lashed into fury like a lion.</p>
<p>We rowed or sailed as the river and the
wind permitted, gaining ground without the
loss of an available minute, with the tenacity
of one who has a given task to accomplish,
and wants to perform it with the least possible
delay. One night, shortly after halting, a
shudder of delight ran through us on hearing
one of the men exclaim, &lsquo;Steamer coming!&rsquo;
We turned in the direction pointed out by him,
but saw nothing. However, we had learnt by
that time to trust to the keener senses of the
natives. Shortly afterwards, with ear to ground,
we heard, or thought we heard, a far-off indistinct
vibration as of the paddles of a steamer
striking the water. The sound soon became
unmistakable. Here was an unexpected redemption.
From sheer joy we ceased the preparations
for our evening meal. To attract the
attention of those on board the steamer the
bonfires were piled up high, and, to leave no
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
possible loophole to adverse fate, Alex and
four of the men sailed into mid-stream, so as to
be quite close to the craft. Soon it loomed
majestic and welcome to our eyes. The pennant
of whitish smoke rose in the still blue night,
and floated as a signal of welcome. The boat
advanced steadily; we could see the people on
board. That rather undersized vessel was to
us, for the moment, the great in fact, the only&mdash;steamer
in the world. We fired our revolvers.
Alex and his men bawled themselves hoarse.
No sign of recognition came from the steamer
as she ploughed on swiftly, relentlessly, disdainfully,
soon to be lost in the distance. This
was wanton cruelty, and, as we thought at the
time, a sin against human nature. Our feelings
were not such as might be commended to the
attention and imitation of Sunday-school children!
Our language was decidedly &lsquo;unfit for
publication.&rsquo; According to the reckoning of our
men, which events proved accurate, we should
require twelve days more to reach Ciudad
Bolivar, whilst the steamer, sailing day and
night as it could, even against the breeze,
would cover the distance in forty-eight or sixty
hours. It is well that we possessed no magic
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
powers enabling us to destroy, as if with a
thunder-bolt, for in that case the steamer would
not have reached its destination. So it generally
happens in life when the action of others foils
our little plans or obstructs our way. Looking
solely to our own side of the question, we are
apt to make no allowance, and attribute to utter
perversity what from the standpoint of the
other side may be perfectly reasonable. As
revolutions are frequent in those latitudes, and
as steamers had on several occasions been
seized by parties of men ambushed on the
shore, the captain of the steamer probably
thought that prudence and caution were his
safest guides. He may have believed that,
besides the small group which he saw in the
canoe and on the shore, a formidable host
might be lurking in the forest, and under
those circumstances his behaviour is perfectly
intelligible.</p>
<p>As we approached the end of our journey,
our impatience and anxiety grew keener. Up
to that time we had never lost our equanimity,
and now, when we could reckon with a fair
degree of accuracy the date of our arrival at
Ciudad Bolivar, the smallest obstacle or detention
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
irritated us beyond measure. Yet all
things end. On April 20 we arrived at a
small outlying village three hours from Ciudad
Bolivar.</p>
<p>Our approach to a civilized community
awakened slumbering feelings of vanity, and
for the first time during many months we bethought
ourselves of our appearance. I had
an authentic mane on my head; our beards
were thick and bushy as the jungle on the
banks of the river. Such clothes as we had
could hardly have passed muster under the
eyes of the most lenient critic. Most of those
that we possessed at starting had been left behind
amongst the Indians, in payment of work,
and what little remained had not been improved
by the moisture of the climate. On taking
stock, I soon found that my dress coat and
trousers&mdash;evolved by some London artist&mdash;were
the only decent clothes left to me; yet I
could not screw up courage to don them, as I
feared that if, after several months&rsquo; journey
through the wildest regions of South America,
I jumped ashore at noonday on the banks of
the Orinoco in a swallow-tail, the authorities
would probably provide me with free board and
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
lodging in some cool lunatic asylum! We consoled
ourselves with the thought that we were
clean, and thus near to godliness, and that we
could soon replace our patched and tattered
clothes at Ciudad Bolivar.</p>
<p>I have forgotten to mention our visit to the
cattle estates of General Crespo, at that time
President of Venezuela, a typical son of the
<i>llanos</i>. These estates had a frontage of twenty-five
leagues along the river, and extend Heaven
only knows how far into the interior. The
manager, or <i>major-domo</i>, told us that the herds
on those estates numbered upwards of 200,000
head of cattle. The figure appears fantastic,
but the fact that at that time 1,500 three-year-old
bullocks were exported monthly to the neighbouring
West India Island, principally Trinidad,
may serve as a basis for calculation.</p>
<p>On that eventful 20th of April the breeze blew
tantalizingly against us, yet we would not be
detained, and decided to advance in its very
teeth. The men jumped ashore and pulled the
canoes with ropes. The city, built as upon
a terrace, soon appeared in the distance, its
white, red-roofed houses standing out under
the clear sky like dabs of paint upon a blue
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
canvas. Behind the town the hill continued to
rise, and opposite the city the river itself, encased
into a narrow space, is only one-third of
a mile broad. It was a delight to look once
more on houses, towers and churches, and other
signs of civilized life. The sight was an enchantment
after the eternal panorama of forest,
mountain, plain and river. We had a feeling
akin to that of Columbus and his companions
when the watch shouted &lsquo;Land! land!&rsquo; We
could echo those words in their full significance.
The struggle was at an end; river, forest,
rapids, fevers, wild beasts, poisonous snakes,
savages, and all the obstacles that lay behind
us, were over, leaving no further trace than
the dust along the roads or the foam of the
waves on the sands. Thanks to the Divine
protection, we had reached the end of an adventurous
journey full of possibilities of mishap
and of danger, and all that had taken place was
simply as a memory in our minds.</p>
<p>We attracted great attention on landing, and
were soon installed in one of the good hotels
of the towns. We stared with something like
wonderment at mirrors, tables, sofas, as at so
many good old friends from whom we had been
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
long separated. In us, primitive man had very
soon reasserted full sway, and we had to make
some effort to return to the habits and customs
of civilized life. As soon as we could, we
placed ourselves in the hands of a barber in
the town. He had been told of our great store
of luggage, and, inquisitive as all men of his
profession are, on hearing one of us humming
for very joy under his razor and shears, asked
(I know not whether in innocence or banter):
&lsquo;How many of you are in the company, and
what opera are you going to begin with?&rsquo;
To this I replied: &lsquo;We are not an opera company,
but a circus, and our performances will
begin shortly; we are on the look-out for a
clown.&rsquo; He did not proceed with his cross-examination.</p>
<p>Ciudad Bolivar is famous in the annals of
Venezuelan and Colombian history. It bears
the name of the emancipator of those regions.
Formerly it was called Angostura, which means
&lsquo;the Narrows.&rsquo; In 1819 one of the first
Colombian Congresses was held at that city,
and its deliberations, which soon crystallized
into action, brought about the expulsion of the
Spaniards after a daring and sanguinary series
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
of campaigns. The very men who sat at
Ciudad Bolivar, 300 miles from the shores of
the Atlantic, ended their military campaign on
the plateau of Ayacucho in 1824, having
marched thousands of leagues across plain and
forests, snow-capped mountains, precipices,
jungle, fighting for every inch of ground against
the stubborn soldiers of Spain in one of the
most heroic and tenacious struggles on both
sides that are to be found in the annals of
history.</p>
<p>The river, as I have stated before, narrows
after its long pilgrimage, and, even as a regiment
which closes its ranks, rolls its waves in denser
array opposite the city. No sooner does it
reach the outside limits than it broadens again,
and, after running through fertile plains and
swampy valleys for a distance of 600 kilometres,
reaches the sea. The normal depth opposite
Ciudad Bolivar is 120 metres. During the
rainy season the level rises from 10 to 20
metres.</p>
<p>Verily the Orinoco is a living, wandering sea
of fresh water gathered from the northern plains
of South America, which forms the tribute of
those lands to the Atlantic Ocean. We had
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
just followed it in its pilgrimage for a long part
of its course. We had known it in tempest and
in calm; we had watched the dawn gilding its
throbbing waters or the twilight covering them
with flickering shadows; we had listened to the
whispering of the winds and the roar of the
hurricane along its shores; we had seen the
monsters which roam in its waters, admired the
river&rsquo;s Titanic sport, dashing in the rapids, or
its majestic quiet in the deep basins of granite
where the current seems to rest before leaping
in a wild onslaught through the ca&ntilde;ons; and
now we saw it majestically unroll before our
eyes in the august pageant of its last procession
to the ocean. We could not but think that,
if that great artery of palpitating life which
vibrates through the centre of the continent had
stood us in such good service, its possibilities
for the development of those vast unknown
territories, when once appreciated by humanity,
were practically unlimited. To our mind&rsquo;s eye,
prophetic with desire, the vast solitudes we had
left behind became resonant glad with the
presence of myriads of men; the forests were
cleared, the plains tilled, and a happy and
prosperous nation, the outcome of the present
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
struggling democracies that own those lands,
increased by swarms of immigrants from distant
overcrowded countries, reared its cities and
towns along the banks of the river which, in its
immutable, defiant majesty and power, still
rolled to the sea, serving men, but remaining a
bond of union, a mighty link between the
Cordilleras and the ocean.</p>

<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p>I have thus far sought to give an idea of my
personal impressions during a journey most
memorable to me; and I am aware that I bring
no new or useful contribution from a scientific
point of view. We had no instruments of
observation, not even an ordinary every-day
compass, enabling us to fix the cardinal points
with certainty. Furthermore, had we possessed
more complicated instruments, we were too
ignorant to use them. Let these remarks be
borne in mind should errors of appreciation be
noticed, as certainly they exist, in this disjointed
narrative.</p>
<p>We wandered on with the definite aim of
reaching the Atlantic Ocean. Beyond that we
did not venture to scrutinize too deeply the
mysterious and wonderful manifestations of
Nature, but took them as they appeared to our
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
limited means of vision and understanding, and
sought nothing beyond.</p>
<p>However, before closing these pages, assuming
that some kind reader&rsquo;s patience may have
enabled him to accompany me thus far, it may
not be amiss to give some accurate data which
I take from the admirable monograph entitled
&lsquo;South America: an Outline of its Physical
Geography,&rsquo; published in the <i>Geographical
Journal</i> of April, 1901, by Colonel George
Earl Church, a book which might be called
&lsquo;South America in a Nutshell,&rsquo; wonderfully
accurate and concise, and worthy of the highest
praise.</p>
<p>The total length of the Orinoco is about 1,500
miles, but if measured by its Guaviari branch
it is several hundred miles longer. It reaches
its maximum height in August. To its point of
junction with the Guaviare it takes a north-west
course. Ninety miles before its union with that
stream it receives its principal eastern affluent,
the Ventuario. From the Guaviare it runs
north nearly as far as the Apure, where it
suddenly turns east. Between the Guaviare
and the Meta the course of the river is
obstructed by the Maipures Rapids, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
extend for a length of four miles, with a total
fall of about 40 feet. Below this the Atures
Rapids cover a distance of about six miles,
falling about 30 feet. Navigation is then
free for about 700 miles, as far as the rapids of
Cariben, within six miles of the mouth of the
Meta. The river at this point is about a mile
wide. Its course continues to the north, and at
the mouth of the Apure it is two miles wide in the
dry season, and about seven when in flood. At
Cariben it rises 32 feet; but at the Angostura, or
&lsquo;Narrows,&rsquo; 372 miles from the sea, it has risen
to 60 feet. It enters the sea by its main trunk,
the Boca Grande. About 100 miles above its
mouth it throws off a branch northward to the
Gulf of Paria, also 100 miles in length. Six
other considerable arms find their way to the
ocean across a vast delta about 7,000 square
miles in area. The Boca Grande is the deepest
and main navigable entrance at all seasons, the
muddy bar usually maintaining a depth of
16 feet. The basin of the Orinoco covers an
area of 364,500 square miles.</p>
<p>The principal affluents flowing from the
Andean slopes are the Apure, the Arauca, the
Meta, and the Guaviare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>The Apure is 695 miles long, of which 564
are navigable. The Apure in its turn receives
numerous tributaries, some of which are navigable
for short distances.</p>
<p>The Arauca, the Meta and the Guaviare, are
also navigable.</p>
<p>The Casiquiare Canal unites the upper
Orinoco with the Rio Negro branch of the
Amazon. It is about 300 miles long, with an
average depth of 30 feet, and has a strong
current in the direction of the Negro. The list
of affluents of the Orinoco and of its tributaries
would be a very long one, and would serve no
useful purpose here.</p>
<p>Evidently the Orinoco and the Orinoco
system, with their innumerable ramifications in
all directions, form a basis for the easy exploitation
of the vast sources of natural wealth which
exist in the immense territory through which
their waters flow.</p>
<p>That territory lies within the borders of the
Republics of Colombia and Venezuela. Up
to the present neither nation has seriously
attempted to utilize the valuable elements so
bountifully offered by Nature. In the matter
of navigation, ocean-going steamers sail frequently
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">241</span>
as far as Ciudad Bolivar. From this
latter point river steamers ply once or twice
a month up the Orinoco, turning into the Apure
as far as San Fernando de Apure, and during
the tonga-bean harvest follow the course of the
main river generally as far as the Caura, where
the harvesters established their central camps
a good many years ago. An effort was made
to establish navigation on the Orinoco and its
affluents above the rapids, and also to run
small steamers in the navigable part between
the Atures and Maipures rapids; but the French
company, which held a charter practically placing
the whole region at its disposal, failed of its
object, after spending a considerable amount of
money. During our journey, in several places
we could see, rotting in the sun, the remnants
of broken-down steamers, which appeared
uncanny objects in those surroundings. The
rapids, acting as a barrier, have deterred traders
and explorers. The upper part of the Orinoco
is the most abundant in natural wealth. As
I have had occasion to note in these pages,
india-rubber, <i>piazaba</i>, tonga bean, resinous and
medicinal plants, are found in practically unlimited
quantities along the shores of all the
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
rivers above the rapids, and the small proportion
which is gathered is generally shipped
through the Rio Negro by way of the Amazon,
as traders prefer that long and tedious journey
to the difficulties of the Orinoco Rapids.</p>
<p>Yet to give life to the Orinoco, to establish
a stream of natural products down its waters,
and to facilitate the opening of the forests and
mountains beyond the rapids, it would not be
necessary to carry out work of a very stupendous
nature, beyond the resources of the peoples and
the nations most interested in the work. A
cursory glance at the elements of the problem
reveals the possibility of carrying out a plan,
the general outlines of which might be the
following:</p>
<p>A line of steamers should be established
plying at least twice a month between Ciudad
Bolivar and the highest accessible point for
navigation below the Atures Rapids.</p>
<p>The old road along the rapids, which extended
from that highest point of navigation to beyond
Maipures where the river is again free and
open, should be reconstructed. A railway could
be built along either shore, the ground being
mostly level and hard. It would not be necessary
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
to undertake great engineering works, and
the road-bed itself would require neither deep
cuttings nor terracing, nor expensive culverts
and works of drainage, and the few bridges
required, being of short span, would not run
into high figures.</p>
<p>Steam navigation should also be established
beyond the rapids on the rivers forming the
upper basin. This could be done at first by
means of small steam-launches such as are used
in the affluents of the Amazon River, but the
service should be carried out faithfully and
periodically, even though at first freight and
passengers were lacking. People in Spanish
America are generally very sceptical as to
these enterprises, but once a feeling of confidence
was created, explorers would flock
both from Colombia and from Venezuela, as
they would know that they would have an
outlet for whatever products they might
gather.</p>
<p>The Indians on the Vichada, and even those
on the Meta, would supply abundant labour,
and the exports of natural products would soon
furnish all the freight that might be desired to
make the whole arrangement of steamers above
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
and below the rapids, and the railway along the
same, a paying concern.</p>
<p>A line of steamers should also follow the
course of the Meta River as far as La Cruz,
a port situated about ninety miles from Bogot&aacute;,
thus tapping the import and export trade of the
most thickly-populated region of Colombia, the
inhabitants of which in the three provinces of
Santander, Boyac&aacute;, and Cundinamarca, are over
1,500,000 in number.</p>
<p>Supposing four steamers to be needed for
navigation on the lower river and on the Meta,
to be bought at Ciudad Bolivar at a cost of
&pound;10,000 each, &pound;40,000 would be required under
this head. Taking the length of the railway
at 60 kilometres, including the bridges, at a
cost of &pound;2,000 per kilometre, &pound;120,000 would
be required for the railway; and supposing that
ten small steam-launches of twenty to thirty
tons burden were started for the rivers on the
upper basin, &pound;20,000 would be required&mdash;in all,
&pound;180,000 for the whole undertaking.</p>
<p>The preceding figures are not imaginative,
and might, perhaps, be reduced in actual
practice. If it has been possible to raise the
capital required for the construction of a railway
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
of upwards of 200 kilometres in length
along the shores of the Congo, where climate,
distance, and natives combine to establish far
more serious obstacles than exist on the
Orinoco, should it not be possible to find
the capital for the establishment of modern
means of transportation in a region which
offers far brighter and surer prospects than
the Congo? Let it be remembered that from
Colombia and from Venezuela civilized white,
coloured and Indian labour could be found in
abundance, and that Europeans engaged in the
undertaking, and provided with steamers, could
in two days, if on the Meta, reach the high
and healthy plateaus of Bogot&aacute; and find themselves
in a civilized community where they
would lack none of the luxuries or comforts
of their own land; and that in the Lower
Orinoco they would have Ciudad Bolivar, to
which the same remarks, barring the advantage
of climate, may be applied. The two Governments
of Colombia and Venezuela, equally
interested in the development of the Orinoco
basin, might unite their efforts and guarantee
in a form satisfactory to European capitalists
the paltry yearly amount required to pay the
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
service of interest and sinking fund on the
&pound;180,000. Taking the interest at 6, with a
sinking fund of 1 per cent., &pound;12,600 yearly
would be required&mdash;that is to say, &pound;6,300 for
each Government. I know that at the present
moment such a task would be well-nigh impossible,
but I also know that if a sincere effort
were made, notwithstanding the universal feeling
of distrust, it would be possible to create securities
specially applicable to this purpose, which
would satisfy the most exacting capitalist.</p>
<p>In the midst of the daily turmoil and agitation
and sanguinary struggle which constitutes the
life of those democracies, these problems, urgent
and vital as they are, pass unheeded; and the
more the pity, for in their solution lies the
basis of a permanent peace. Prosperity begets
abhorrence of internal revolutions. The development
of Mexico is a case in point, from
which Colombia and Venezuela might take
heed. Woe to them if they do not! The
world begins to sicken at the very mention
of the constant strife which converts into a
positive hell those regions where Nature has
shown herself prodigal beyond measure in all
her gifts. Not only the valley of the Orinoco,
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
with its boundless prairies, its dense forests,
and its innumerable affluents, but the uplands
of the Andine regions and the plains extending
in Venezuela towards the North Atlantic or
Caribbean Sea, and in Colombia to the Pacific
Ocean, are coveted by nations where humanity
is overcrowded by races which would fain
establish colonies in those regions. The
development of humanity cannot be stayed;
the human wave, even as the stream of water
contained by a dyke, will sooner or later break
through the walls that imprison it and flood the
surrounding country. It were well for men
animated by real patriotism in Colombia and
in Venezuela to ponder over these possibilities,
so that the two nations might themselves open
the flood-gates for immigration without delay,
so that the new-comers would prove a fresh
source of strength and power, helping to build
up on the basis of the now existing nations
free and mighty commonwealths, rather than
as conquerors, who (whether they come from
the North as wolves in sheep&rsquo;s clothing under
cover of the Monroe doctrine, or from across
the ocean, driven by necessity stronger than all
political conventionality) would come as masters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>Now is our accepted time. The moments
are counted during which the danger may be
averted and the inevitable turned to account;
but, alas! feuds and errors deep-rooted in
medieval soil, luxuriant in this our twentieth
century, darken the minds of men, influence
their judgment, turn away their activity from
the real aims that would lead their nations to
greatness, and force them into barbarous
struggles which the world regards with amazement
and brands as crimes against mankind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p>After a week in Ciudad Bolivar, we bethought
ourselves of continuing the journey to the
sea. Civilization had reclaimed us for her own,
and rigged in European attire, such as befits
the tropics, with all the social conventionalities
once again paramount in our mind, we set forth
on that, the last stage of the journey. We had
been, not a nine days&rsquo; but a nine hours&rsquo; wonder
in the historical town which rears its houses
and churches alongside the narrows of the
majestic stream. Early in the afternoon of a
dazzling tropical day, cloudless, blue and hazy
from the very brilliancy of the air, we stepped
into the large steamboat that was to carry
us to the neighbouring British island of Trinidad,
once also a Spanish possession. The
usual events accompanying the departure of
all steamers from the shore repeated themselves:
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">250</span>
clanging of chains, shouting of orders,
groans of the huge structure, shrill whistles,
and that trepidation, the dawn as it were of
motion, something like a hesitation of things
inert apparently unwilling to be set in motion,
which is the life of matter inanimate; then the
steady throbbing of the machinery, the stroke
of the paddles, splash, splash, until regularity
and monotony are attained, and the ship,
wheeled into midstream after describing a broad
arc, set the prow eastward with the current to
the ocean.</p>
<p>We looked at the town as it dwindled indistinct,
seeming to sink into the vast azure of the
horizon, swallowed in the scintillating folds of
the blue distance. We sat on the deck as if in
a trance. Shortly after starting, wild Nature
reasserted her sway, and the small oasis built
by the hand of man in the heart of the untamed
region, seemed to us who knew how
unmeasurable were those forests and those
plains, like a tiny nest perched on the branches
of a lofty and over-spreading <i>ceiba</i>. A feeling
of superiority over our fellow-passengers unconsciously
filled our breasts. For were we
not boon companions, fellow-travellers, tried
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
and trusted comrades of those rushing waters?
Had we not shared their pilgrimage for days
and days, in calm and in storm, in sunshine
and in darkness? Had we not slept on their
bosom or travelled upon it for countless hours,
till the secret of their mystery and the joy of
their wandering had penetrated into our very
soul? What knew they, the other travellers
of a few hours, of the intimate life of those
waters which we had watched, gathering their
strength from all the points of the compass,
swelling the current of the central stream,
mingling their life with it, now as rivulets, now
as rivers, now placid in the embrace, now
plunging, foaming, as if loath to loose their identity?
Yea, verily, we were comrades, fellow-pilgrims,
with the splendid travelling sea, there
on its final march to the boundless deep.</p>
<p>Forest and plain, marsh, morass, jungle, succeeded
one another in interminable procession,
and the setting sun now broke its ray on the
low-lying hills, now reverberated on the far-off
marshes on either side of the current, tinging
them with a crimson glow. Towards sunset
the whistle of the steamer frightened a flock of
flamingoes gathered to roost, as is their wont
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
when the shadows of evening approach. The
whole flock sought refuge in flight, and their
widespread wings, as they rose before us,
seemed like a huge transparent pink curtain
lifted before our very eyes, rising higher and
higher until it vanished in space.</p>
<p>Night fell upon the scene. First the stars
and then the moon kindled their beacon fires,
dispelling darkness into a semi-obscurity fraught
with mystery, embalmed with the effluvia from
the forest and the river. We felt like a shadow
crossing the wilderness. The littleness of self,
the insignificance of the human being, became
overwhelming.</p>
<p>What could it matter if that daring shell with
its human freight were dashed to pieces against
a submerged tree and swallowed in the waves?
Nature, impassible, would take no notice of the
event; in far-off homes sorrow would fill the
loving hearts. The river would be looked
upon as a grave, wondrous vast, where a dear
one had found his rest, but the river itself
would suffer no change, and our world of hopes,
ambitions, infinite longings, would leave no
more trace than the smallest bubble of the
floating foam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>And thus the morrow came. With the light
of day the circle of the horizon broadened; we
were out at sea, no trace of land was visible.
The waves tossed the struggling craft tenderly,
gliding under its keel, the wind caressed the
flying pennants on the mastheads and seemed
to whisper promises of freedom as it rustled
through the rigging. The mighty river had
disappeared, paying its tribute, like a human
being to the grave, to Father Ocean. And the
long journey which lay behind us was nothing
more than a dream in our memory, for things
dreamt and things lived do so intermingle their
identity in our minds that the attempt to disentangle
their threads were useless. And so
we drifted into the broad, unmeasurable expanse
of waters which seemed to palpitate and
tremble as with the touch of life under the
glorious rays of the morning sun.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
